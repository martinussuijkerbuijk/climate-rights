"2025-07-25 07:35:15","PHLNews","shell","The Royal Thai Army deployed its M758 Autonomous Howitzer early Thursday, firing multiple 155mm shells at Cambodian military positions near the Preah Vihear temple. The strikes mark a sharp escalation following Cambodia’s RM-70 rocket barrage that killed at least 14 civilians in Thai border towns. Thailand’s Defense Ministry said the precision artillery strike targeted command posts and artillery depots used in recent attacks. No official casualty figures have been released by Phnom Penh, but regional observers warn the exchange risks triggering a broader conflict if diplomacy fails.","https://t.me/PHLNews/194719"
