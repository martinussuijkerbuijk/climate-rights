While the Court upheld the standing of Mr. Haughton to bring the case, it dismissed his substantive claims on the basis that the decisions had been made within the power given to the Minister under Part 3A of the Environmental Planning and Assessment  Act 1979 (NSW).  Justice Craig emphasized that he could not review the merits of the Minister’s decision, and could only consider its legality.

One of the principal issues related to potential flooding and the decision is the first to apply the State Coastal Planning Policy anticipating a 0.38 meter increase in sea level due to climate change. The Tribunal determined that the development application warranted conditional approval. With respect to potential flooding, the Tribunal found that the level of the water table over the lifetime of the development, including anticipated increase in the water table due to sea level rise by 2100, would not compromise the structural stability of the building or cause water ingress. Thus, the proposal did not warrant refusal because of potential for flooding. The development application was approved subject to 40 conditions including conditions to ensure that the development is carried out in a manner that is appropriate having regard to heritage and amenity considerations.

The Department failed to respond to the request within 45 days (as required by the Act). After proceedings were commenced, some documents were produced and issues in dispute were eventually narrowed to four particular documents.  Three of these documents related to allocation of licenses to mine coal, and the fourth related to the premium feed-in tariff scheme.  In withholding these documents, the Department relied on an exception to FOIA which protects cabinet documents (for the three coal related documents), and an exception which protects internal working documents (in relation to all four documents). The Tribunal held that, with the exception of an introductory portion of one document, that the three coal license related documents were protected by the exception for internal working documents, as they had been prepared in order to brief the Minister on issues “of the utmost importance to Victorians.”  The high level nature of the briefing documents, and the sensitivity of the issues involved, were considerations that weighed against their release under FOIA.  The document relating to the premium feed-in tariff scheme was held not to be protected by any of the exceptions.",

The Hunter Environment Lobby objected to the proposal, notably on the ground that the extensions would have an important impact on climate change. Nevertheless, the project was approved by the Planning Minister in November 2010 and the Hunter Environment Lobby appealed. In its decision, the Court distinguished between direct GHG emissions (Scope 1 GHG emissions) and indirect GHG emissions (Scope 2 GHG emissions), i.e. emissions from the consumption of purchased electricity. With respect to direct emissions, the Court held that it was lawful and reasonably implementable to take them into account in the approval process. The Court further highlighted that it was not discriminatory to do so as upcoming approvals would follow the same rule. However, the Court refused to impose any condition with respect to indirect emissions. The Court thus affirmed the approval, but subject to certain conditions, including a condition which required the offset of any direct GHG emissions from the mine. This condition could be suspended if another law or regulation was introduced which would cover these emissions. \r\n\r\nFollowing this initial decision, the Australian Government introduced a carbon price, which was implemented through federal legislation.  In light of this new scheme, in a subsequent decision the Court held that it was valid for the Minister to decide that the condition on the mine relating to offsetting of direct emissions was no longer necessary.",

While the claims made by landowners focused on the local impacts of the mine, such as potential water contamination and sound levels, Friends of the Earth argued that the lease and environmental authority should not be granted on the basis that the project will contribute to climate change and ocean acidification.  The proponent for the proposed mine, Xstrata Coal, argued that they were under no obligation to disclose the “Scope 3” emissions of a project during the environmental impact assessment process. Scope 3 emissions include indirect GHG emissions which occur at sites away from the mine, such emissions from transporting the coal and from its end-use in electricity production.  Friends of the Earth argued that these scope 3 emissions must be considered when assessing the potential environmental impact of the mine.  The Court held that it could only consider the environmental impacts of the mine itself, and not of other activities such as the transport of coal or its end-use.  In addition, it held that while the direct GHG emissions of the mine may contribute to climate change, that this should not outweigh all other considerations in the assessment process for the mine, such as the potential economic benefit to the State of Queensland.

      "type": "case",
      "count": 1,
      "summary": "Similar to the Urgenda case in the Netherlands, the Klimaatzaak -- \"climate case\" -- was brought by an organization of concerned citizens, and 58,000 citizen co-plaintiffs, arguing that Belgian law requires the Belgian government's approach to reducing greenhouse gas emissions to be more aggressive. The suit named the Belgian State, the Walloon Region, the Flemish Region, and the Brussels-Capital Region as defendants. Specifically, plaintiffs called for reductions of 40% below 1990 levels by 2020 and 87.5% below 1990 levels by 2050.\r\n\r\nFrom February 2019 through March 2020, the parties submitted their main conclusions and final conclusions. In their main conclusions, the plaintiffs seek a Court injunction directing the government to reduce emissions 42 to 48% in 2025 and at least 55 to 65% in 2030. Oral arguments were heard from March 16 to 26, 2021. \r\n\r\nOn June 17, 2021, the Brussels Court of First Instance held that the Belgium government breached its duty of care by failing to take necessary measures to prevent the harmful effects of climate change, but declined to set specific reduction targets on separation of powers grounds. \r\n\r\nThe Court first analyzed whether the claim was admissible, and, in doing so, whether the plaintiffs established that the proceedings would provide a benefit to them. Article 17 of the Judicial Code excludes actions brought in the general interest that only indirectly benefit the plaintiff. The Court found that both the 58,000 co-plaintiffs and the Klimaatzaak organization have a personal interest in the action. The citizen co-plaintiffs have a direct, personal interest because they seek to hold Belgian authorities responsible for the climate consequences on their daily lives, and the fact that other Belgian citizens may also suffer damages does not transform their interest into a general one. The Klimaatzaak organization has a direct, personal interest in part because environmental organizations have a privileged status to sue to defend the environmental from harm.\r\n\r\nThe Court found the federal state and the three regions jointly and individually in breach of their duty of care for failing to enact good climate governance. The Court found that despite being aware of the certain risk of dangerous climate change to the country's population, the authorities failed to take necessary action, meaning that they failed to act with prudence and diligence under Article 1382 of the Civil Code. Further, by failing to take sufficient climate action to protect the life and privacy of the plaintiffs, the defendants were in breach of their obligations under Articles 2 and 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights.\r\n\r\nHowever, the Court declined to issue an injunction ordering the government to set the specific emission reduction targets requested by the plaintiffs. The Court found that the separation of powers doctrine limited the Court's ability to set such targets, and doing so would contravene legislative or administrative authority. Neither European nor international law required the specific reduction targets requested by the plaintiffs, and that the scientific report that they relied on, while scientifically meritorious, was not legally binding. The specific targets, therefore, were a matter for the legislative and executive bodies to decide. \r\n\r\nOn November 17, 2021, Klimaatzaak appealed the judgment of the Brussels Court of First Instance. The appeal is primarily aimed at the Tribunal's refusal to set specific binding targets related to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions over time. Klimaatzaak notably argues that the Brussels Court of First Instance has confused two distinct sources of liability in its analysis of Article 1382 of the Belgian Civil Code in that it confined itself to taking as a reference only the emission reduction targets laid down by rules of positive international, European and Belgian law, and refrained from analyzing the authorities' conduct in the light of their knowledge of the danger and of what needed to be done to help prevent or limit it. Klimaatzaak also asks the Court of Appeal to repeal and correct what they argue are factual or legal errors in the judgment of June 17, 2021. The defending Governments are expected to reply to this petition and the Brussels Court of Appeal will review the factual and the legal components of the case in the course of the appeal procedure.\r\n\r\nAfter a written round of conclusions that will take sixteen months, the case was heard from September 14 to October 6, 2023.\r\n\r\nThe Court of Appeal of Brussels handed down its decision on November 30, 2023. The Court confirmed the finding of breaches established at first instance (except in the case of the Walloon Region), but in addition, ordered the condemned authorities to reduce their GHG emissions. Unlike the judge at first instance, the Court therefore considers that using its power of injunction against public authorities does not necessarily infringe the principle of separation of powers, provided that the judge does not take the place of the authorities in choosing the means to remedy violations. Competent Belgian public authorities (the Federal State, Flemish Region and the Brussels-Capital Region) have been ordered to reduce their GHG emissions of 55% compared to the 1990 level by 2030. The grounds of this decision are based on the breach of human rights (articles 2 and 8 of the ECHR) and civil liability rules (articles 1382 and 1383 of the (Former) Civil Code). \r\n\r\nHowever, the Court reformed the first instance judgment towards the Walloon Region by establishing that this authority is already playing its role in the fight against climate change. Therefore, the Court observes that there is no breach of human rights or civil liability rules on the part of the Walloon Region. The Court suspended its ruling on the question of the penalty payment and the production of the GHG emissions reports, depending on the official figures to be produced for the period 2020-2024 by the convicted authorities. The parties have 3 months to lodge a final recourse with the Court of Cassation.",

      "summary": "This case was a request for a preliminary ruling on two 2009 amendments to the agricultural rules in the Council Regulation that establish economic support schemes for farmers. The support scheme provided direct income support to farmers, however it was amended such that all direct payments beyond a certain amount should be reduced by a certain percentage each year.  The savings made through these reductions would then be used to finance measures under the rural development policy, in light of the “new and demanding challenges” faced by the agriculture sector, “such as climate change and the increasing importance of bio-energy, as well as the need for better water management and more effective protection of biodiversity.”  The Preamble also noted that Parties to the Kyoto Protocol, the EU and its member states are called upon to “adapt its policies in the light of climate change considerations.”\r\n\r\nThe Court reviewed two issues: (1) whether a new provision to the Regulation to reduce the amount of direct payments to farmers was valid, against an existing provision that already set the amount, in light of the principle of protecting legitimate expectations; (2) and whether a four percent increase for farmers with larger holdings exceeding 300,000 euros violates the principle of non-discrimination. The Court ruled that the purpose of the earlier provision was to establish support schemes for farmers, and that the decreases in direct payments, as well as the percentage of reductions were valid, and did not violate any applicable principles of EU law.",

      "summary": "Advocate General Sharpston was asked for guidance as to the meaning of the term ‘dual use’ in the second indent of Article 2(4)(b) in relation to sugar production and lime fertilizer, the by-product arising from that process, of the Directive 2003/96/EC, which introduced a regime imposing minimum harmonized levels of taxation on all energy products and electricity. The referring court also asked whether national legislators are constrained by an EU concept of what constitutes dual use if they choose to introduce domestic measures in order to tax such energy products. \r\n\r\nThe Advocate General answered that ‘dual use’ within the meaning of Article 2(4)(b) refers to where coal is used as heating fuel in a lime-kiln in order to generate carbon dioxide for the production of lime-kiln gas, which is subsequently used for the purification of the raw juice obtained from sugar beets, that process giving rise to the by-product earth foam. The Advocate General found that Member States may apply a more restrictive definition of dual use and choose to tax dual use energy products, provided they exercise their competence consistently with EU law. If a Member State chooses to apply such a narrower definition, a taxpayer cannot invoke a broader EU concept of dual use in order to obtain exoneration from a charge to tax imposed under national law.

      "type": "case",
      "count": 1,
      "summary": "Sarah Thomson, a New Zealand law student, filed a Statement of Claim in 2015 against New Zealand’s Minister of Climate Change Issues alleging that the Minister had failed in several respects regarding the setting of greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets required by New Zealand’s Climate Change Response Act of 2002. That Act implements New Zealand’s responsibilities as a ratifying Annex I member of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). It requires the Minister to set an emissions reduction target in keeping with the statements of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and to consider whether to revise that target as the IPCC issues updated findings. In March 2011, pursuant to the 2002 Act, the Minister had set a target of 50% reduction from 1990 greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions levels by 2050. The Minister did not review or revise that target following the 2014 issuance of the IPCC’s Fifth Assessment Report. In July 2015, in advance of the 21st Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC in Paris, the Minister submitted New Zealand’s intended nationally determined contribution (INDC)--and then subsequently a nationally determined contribution (NDC)--consistent with a “provisional target” of only 30% reduction from 2005 levels by 2030. As Thomson's Statement of Claim noted, “this equates to a reduction of 11% below New Zealand’s 1990 emission levels by 2030,” and thus “will not, if adopted by other developed countries in combination with appropriate targets set by developing countries, stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.” Thus Thompson challenged both the target set pursuant to the 2002 law and the target set as part of New Zealand's NDC pursuant to the United National Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement, both ratified by New Zealand.\r\n\r\nThe High Court of New Zealand issued its decision after the 2017 election had ousted the prior government, replacing it with a government whose members had campaigned on a commitment to eliminate all GHG emissions by 2050. Nonetheless, the court reviewed both the 2030 and 2050 targets set by the prior government's Minister and ruled on their legality. With respect to the 2050 target, the court determined that although the Minister had discretion under the 2002 act to review and determine New Zealand's emissions reduction target for 2050, that discretion was limited by the act's purpose and by the evidence contained in IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5), both of which argued strongly for a lower national emissions target than the one set based on the IPCC's Fourth Assessment Report (AR4). However, because it was not clear that a review of the 2050 target in light of AR5 would certainly have led to the target's revision, and because the question was largely mooted by the recent election (\"[s]uch a declaration would now be of historic interest only\"), the court concluded merely that the Minister should have reviewed the target, but not that a decision to maintain the existing target after such a review would necessarily have been unlawful. With respect to the 2030 target in New Zealand's INDC and NDC, the court determined that it had authority to review the Minister's setting of that target but no grounds for invalidating it because the Minister had not made “any reviewable error for which the Court may intervene.” \r\n\r\nRegarding the authority of the courts to review climate change policy, the decision noted:\r\n\r\n\"It may be appropriate for domestic courts to play a role in Government decision making about climate change policy . . . The courts have not considered the entire subject matter is a “no go” area, whether because the state had entered into international obligations, or because the problem is a global one and one country’s efforts alone cannot prevent harm to that country’s people and their environment, or because the Government’s response involves the weighing of social, economic and political factors, or because of the complexity of the science. The courts have recognised the significance of the issue for the planet and its inhabitants and that those within the court’s jurisdiction are necessarily amongst all who are affected by inadequate efforts to respond to climate change. The various domestic courts have held they have a proper role to play in Government decision making on this topic, while emphasising that there are constitutional limits in how far that role may extend. The IPCC reports provide a factual basis on which decisions can be made. Remedies are fashioned to ensure appropriate action is taken while leaving the policy choices about the content of that action to the appropriate state body.\"\r\n",

      "summary": "Asghar Leghari, a Pakistani farmer sued the national government for failure to carry out the National Climate Change Policy of 2012 and the Framework for Implementation of Climate Change Policy (2014-2030). Leghari argued that the government should pursue climate mitigation or adaptation efforts, and that the government’s failure to meet its climate change adaptation targets had resulted in immediate impacts on Pakistan’s water, food, and energy security. Such impacts offended his fundamental right to life.\r\n\r\nOn September 4, 2015, an appellate court in Pakistan granted the Leghari's claims, describing climate change as a defining challenge of our time. Citing domestic and international legal principles, the court determined that \"the delay and lethargy of the State in implementing the Framework offend the fundamental rights of the citizens.\" The court reasoned that the constitutional rights to life and human dignity (under articles 9 and 14 of the constitution) included the right to a healthy and clean environment. Further, interpretation of these fundamental rights must be guided by (i) the constitutional values of democracy, equality, and social, economic, and political justice; and (ii) international environmental principles of sustainable development, precautionary principle, intergenerational and intragenerational equity, and the doctrine of public trust.\r\n\r\nAlthough the government had formulated a climate change policy and implementation framework, the court concluded there had been no real progress with implementation. To oversee the execution of the policy, the court (i) directed several government ministries to each nominate \"a climate change focal person\" to help ensure the implementation of the Framework, and to present a list of action points by December 31, 2015; and (ii) created a Climate Change Commission composed of representatives of key ministries, NGOs, and technical experts to monitor the government's progress. On September 14, 2015, the court issued a supplemental decision naming 21 individuals to the Commission and vesting it with various powers. \r\n\r\nOn January 25, 2018, the court took note of the submission of a report from the Climate Change Committee noting that during the period from September 2015 to January 2017 66% of the priority actions from the Framework for Implementation Climate Change Policy have been implemented. After dissolving the commission, the court constituted a standing committee, creating an ongoing link between the court and the executive. \r\n\r\nIn its final order, the court nominated climate justice as the successor to environmental justice. Environmental justice—said the court—revolved around enforcing national laws, with decisions informed by international legal principles. It focused on shifting or stopping pollutive industries. Climate justice, as the court envisioned it, adopted a human-centered approach. It linked human rights with development. It sought to safeguard the rights of vulnerable peoples and share “the burdens and benefits of climate change and its impacts equitably and fairly.” Climate justice was “informed by science, responds to science and acknowledges the need for equitable stewardship of the world’s resources”. However, realizing that climate justice was challenging, the court acknowledged that polluters often fell beyond national borders and were difficult to identify. Finally, the court outlined its vision for water justice as a human right to access clean water and a sub-concept of climate justice. ",

      "summary": "A Dutch environmental group, the Urgenda Foundation, and 900 Dutch citizens sued the Dutch government to require it to do more to prevent global climate change. The court in the Hague ordered the Dutch state to limit GHG emissions to 25% below 1990 levels by 2020, finding the government’s existing pledge to reduce emissions by 17% insufficient to meet the state’s fair contribution toward the UN goal of keeping global temperature increases within two degrees Celsius of pre-industrial conditions. The court concluded that the state has a duty to take climate change mitigation measures due to the “severity of the consequences of climate change and the great risk of climate change occurring.” In reaching this conclusion, the court cited (without directly applying) Article 21 of the Dutch Constitution; EU emissions reduction targets; principles under the European Convention on Human Rights; the “no harm” principle of international law; the doctrine of hazardous negligence; the principle of fairness, the precautionary principle, and the sustainability principle embodied in the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change; and the principle of a high protection level, the precautionary principle, and the prevention principle embodied in the European climate policy. The court did not specify how the government should meet the reduction mandate, but offered several suggestions, including emissions trading or tax measures. This is the first decision by any court in the world ordering states to limit greenhouse gas emissions for reasons other than statutory mandates. \r\n\r\nThe Dutch government submitted 29 grounds of appeal. Urgenda submitted a cross-appeal, contesting the court’s decision that Urgenda cannot directly invoke Articles 2 & 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) in these proceedings.\r\n\r\nOn Oct 9, 2018, the Hague Court of Appeal upheld the District Court's ruling, concluding that by failing to reduce greenhouse gas emissions  by  at least 25% by end-2020, the Dutch government is acting unlawfully in contravention of its duty of care under Articles 2 and 8 of the ECHR. The court recognized Urgenda’s claim under Article 2 of the ECHR, which protects a right to life, and Article 8 of the ECHR, which protects the right to private life, family life, home, and correspondence. The court determined that the Dutch government has an obligation under the ECHR to protect these rights from the real threat of climate change. The court rejected the government’s argument that the lower court decision constitutes “an order to create legislation” or violation of trias politica and the role of courts under the Dutch constitution. In response to these appeals, the court affirmed its obligation to apply provisions with direct effect of treaties to which the Netherlands is party, including Articles 2 and 8 of the ECHR. Further, the court found nothing in Article 193 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union that prohibits a member state from taking more ambitious climate action than the E.U. as a whole, nor that adaptation measures can compensate for the government’s duty of care to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions, nor that the global nature of the problem excuses the Dutch government from action.\r\n\r\nThe Dutch government appealed the decision, and the Netherlands' Supreme Court heard the appeal on May 24, 2019. On September 13 the Advocate and Procurator General, independent judicial officers, issued a formal opinion recommending that the Supreme Court uphold the decision.\r\n\r\nOn December 20, 2019, the Supreme Court of the Netherlands upheld the decision under Articles 2 and 8 of the ECHR. \r\n",

      "summary": "In 2016, a group of senior women, filed suit against the Federal Council, the Federal Department of the Environment Transport, Energy and Communications (DETEC), The Federal Office for the Environment, and the Federal Office for Energy, , alleging that these bodies of the Swiss Government had failed to uphold obligations under the Swiss Constitution and European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) by not steering Switzerland onto an emissions reduction trajectory consistent with the goal of keeping global temperatures well below 2ºC above pre-industrial levels. Specifically, petitioners alleged the government had violated articles 10 (right to life), 73 (sustainability principle), and 74 (environmental protection) of the Swiss Constitution and by articles 2 and 8 ECHR. The petitioners alleged that their demographic group is especially vulnerable to the heat waves expected to result from climate change. They called upon the Swiss parliament and the relevant federal agencies to develop a regulatory approach to several sectors that would achieve greenhouse gas emissions reductions of at least 25% below 1990 levels by 2020, and at least 50% below 1990 levels by 2050. The petition criticized both the targets under discussion at the time in parliament (20% by 2020, and 30% by 2030) and the measures by which the Government would pursue those targets.\r\n\r\nThe petition was dismissed by DETEC on 25 April 2017. DETEC found that petitioners lacked standing because their rights were not affected as required by Article 25a (1) APA (Administrative Procedure Act, Verwaltungsverfahrensgesetz,VwVG). DETEC determined that petitioners sought regulation of global CO2 emissions through general regulations rather than seeking a remedy for an infringement of their specific legal rights. DETEC further found that petitioners did not have victim status under the ECHR because they sought an injunction to serve the wider public interest of adoption of legislative reform to reduce CO2 emissions. Petitioners appealed the dismissal on May 26, 2017.\r\n\r\nOn November 27, 2018, the Swiss Federal Administrative Court rejected the appeal holding that Swiss women over 75 years of age are not exclusively affected by climate change impacts (thus echoing DETEC’s determination that the injury and remedy were not specialized to claimants). In January 2019, the claimants lodged an appeal against the judgment with Swiss Supreme Court. On May 20, 2020, the Supreme Court rejected the appeal. The Court held that the plaintiffs' asserted rights had not been affected with sufficient intensity, and that the remedy they seek must be achieved through political rather than legal means.\r\n\r\nOn November 26, 2020, having exhausted all available legal remedies in Switzerland, the claimants filed an application to the European Court of Human Rights.

The court noted several important features of páramos, including their fragility, their lack of regulatory protection, their role in providing Colombia with as much as 70 percent of its drinking water, and the capacity of their soils and vegetation to capture carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. The court highlighted the last of these features in particular, calling páramos a “carbon capture system” and explaining that a páramos’ carbon capture capacity exceeds that of a comparably-sized tropical rainforest. \r\n\r\nLaw No. 1450 of 2011 established Colombia’s National Development Plan 2010–2014, and Law No. 1753 of 2015 established its 2014–2018 successor. Two provisions in the latter law are especially notable here. The first of these authorizes the Commission on Intersectoral Infrastructure and Strategic Projects to designate particular projects as being in the national strategic interest—a designation that exempts projects from aspects of local regulatory oversight. The second provision prohibits various activities—agriculture, mining, oil and gas exploration and refining—in páramos, but only if project owners received a lease and environmental permit for mining after February 9, 2010 or for oil and gas operations after June 16, 2011. Thus the law authorizes projects that received permits prior to those dates. \r\n\r\nThe Court declared both of these provisions (and others) unconstitutional for, among other things, endangering the public’s right to clean water, and relieving government agencies of their obligation to justify decisions certain to result in the degradation of environmentally sensitive and valuable areas. \r\n",

      "summary": "A coalition of environmental groups sought a declaratory judgment from the Oslo District Court that Norway’s Ministry of Petroleum and Energy violated the Norwegian constitution by issuing a block of oil and gas licenses for deep-sea extraction from sites in the Barents Sea. Their petition highlighted several key factual points: \r\n\r\n -- the licenses would allow access to as-yet undeveloped fossil fuel deposits, and such development is inconsistent with the climate change mitigation required to avert global warming of 1.5°C and possibly even 2°C in excess of pre-industrial levels;\r\n -- the area made accessible by the licenses would be the northernmost yet developed, and would abut the ice zone—thus rigs and tankers would be exposed to unprecedented risks of damage and spills, and their operation would deliver emissions of black carbon to the highly sensitive arctic; and\r\n -- the Norwegian government will incur costs to develop the sites, and will only recoup those costs if the oil and gas they produce commands and adequately high market price. \r\n\r\nIt situated these points in a legal context shaped most fundamentally by article 112 of the Norwegian Constitution, which establishes a “right to an environment that is conducive to health and to a natural environment whose productivity and diversity are maintained.” Other constitutional provisions cited in the petition as relevant to the licensing decision included those requiring government action to be consistent with: the precautionary principle; the no harm principle as it applies both domestically and to citizens of other countries; and human rights protections. The petition was filed by Young Friends of the Earth and Greenpeace, together with the Grandparents Climate Campaign and Friends of the Earth Norway. \r\n\r\nThe Oslo District Court ruled in favor of the Norwegian Government on January 4, 2018. The court recognized that Article 112 of the Constitution is a rights provision, but found that the government did not violate any relevant rights because it had fulfilled the necessary duties before making the licensing decision. The court also declared that, “[e]missions of CO2 abroad from oil and gas exported from Norway are irrelevant when assessing whether the Decision entails a violation of Article 112.” In its assessment of whether the government had fulfilled its duties in regard to traditional environmental harm or other climate effects, the court noted that the Storting, (the Norwegian Parliament), had broadly agreed to open the southeast Barents Sea to licensing and had considered proposals to halt that licensing or review whether it was inappropriate in light of the goals of the Paris Agreement on climate change. According to the court’s decision, the involvement of the Storting could be found in itself sufficient to indicate that the duty to take measures had been fulfilled. \r\n \t\r\nGreenpeace Nordic and Nature and Youth appealed the decision to the Bogarting Court of Appeal. Appellants allege that “[t]he District Court erred in interpreting Article 112 in such a way that it limits the duty of the Norwegian government to guarantee the right to a healthy environment.” They argue that the court interpreted Article 112 too restrictively in reaching the determination that Norway is only responsible for the greenhouse gas emissions released within Norwegian territory.\r\n\r\nOn January 22, 2020, the Borgarting Court of Appeal affirmed the District Court's decision ruling that the oil and gas licenses are valid. The appellate court parted company with the District Court in holding that article 112 of the Norwegian Constitution applies to the environmental damages alleged, including emissions of greenhouse gases from the combustion of oil and gas after export, and that emissions resulting from the relevant decision cannot be considered in isolation. However, the Court of Appeal held that the threshold for a violation of article 112 is high, and courts should exercise restraint in reviewing decisions by the political branches. The Court held that the appellants could not show a violation of article 112 in this instance, particularly because it is uncertain whether and to what extent to the licenses will lead to increased greenhouse gas emissions. The plaintiffs appealed the decision on February 24, 2020. The Norwegian Supreme Court granted leave to appeal on April 20. \r\n\r\nOn December 22, 2020, the Supreme Court announced its decision rejecting the appeal and upholding the licenses for deep-sea extraction. Eleven of the 15 judge panel upheld the lower court's ruling. The Court reasoned that although the Norwegian constitution protects citizens from environmental and climate harms, the future emissions from exported oil are too uncertain to bar the granting of these petroleum exploration licenses. The Court's reading of the decision is available <a href=\"https://www.greenpeace.org/norway/people-vs-arctic-oil-the-judgement/\">here</a>. \r\n\r\nThe plaintiffs referred the case to the European Court of Human Rights on June 15, 2021.

      "type": "case",
      "count": 1,
      "summary": "In November 2015, Saúl Luciano Lliuya, a Peruvian farmer who lives in Huaraz, Peru, filed claims for declaratory judgment and damages in the District Court Essen, Germany against RWE, Germany’s largest electricity producer. Luciano Lliuya’s suit, supported by NGO Germanwatch, alleged that RWE, having knowingly contributed to climate change by emitting substantial volumes of greenhouse gases (GHGs), bore some measure of responsibility for the melting of mountain glaciers near his town of Huaraz. Especially, as the melting gave rise to an acute threat: Palcacocha, a glacial lake located above Huaraz, has experienced substantial volumetric increase since 1975, which has dramatically accelerated from 2003 onwards. Luciano Lliuya presented several legal theories in support of his claim, including one that characterized RWE's emissions as a nuisance due to which plaintiff had incurred compensable costs to mitigate. Acknowledging that RWE was a contributor to the emissions responsible for climate change and thus for the lake's growth, Luciano Lliuya asked the court to order RWE to reimburse him for a portion of the costs that he and the Huaraz authorities are expected to incur from setting up flood protections. The share calculated amounted to 0.47% of the total cost - the same percentage as RWE’s estimated contribution to global industrial greenhouse gas emissions since the beginning of industrialization (from 1751 onwards).\r\n\r\nThe district court dismissed Luciano Lliuya’s requests for declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as his request for damages. The court noted that it could not provide Luciano Lliuya with effective redress (Luciano Lliuya's situation would not change, the court held, even if RWE ceased emitting), and that no “linear causal chain” could be discerned amid the complex components of the causal relationship between particular greenhouse gas emissions and particular climate change impacts.\r\n\r\nOn November 30, 2017, the appeals court – the Higher Regional Court of Hamm – recognized the complaint as well-pled and admissible, allowing the case to move into the evidentiary phase. Here, it will be determined whether Luciano Lliuya’s home is: (a) threatened by flooding or mudslides as a result of the recent increase in the volume of the glacial lake located nearby, and (b) how RWE’s greenhouse gas emissions contribute to that risk. The appeals court will review expert opinion on RWE’s CO2 emissions, the contribution of those emissions to climate change, the resulting impact on the Palcaraju Glacier, and RWE’s contributory share of responsibility for causing the resulting effects. Due to the ongoing pandemic, the on-site visit has had to be postponed several times and has yet to take place. While the facts of this case must still be adjudicated, the court’s recognition that a private company could potentially be held liable for the climate change related damages of its greenhouse gas emissions marks a significant development in law.\r\n\r\nAfter a long delay, especially due to the coronavirus pandemic, a site visit took place in the Andean city of Huaraz in May 2022. Judges of the Higher Regional Court (OLG) of Hamm (Germany), court-appointed experts and lawyers for both parties travelled to Peru to examine whether the plaintiff's house is threatened by a possible flood wave from the glacier lake Palcacocha above the city.\r\n\r\nOn May 28, 2025, the Higher Regional Court (Oberlandesgericht, OLG) of Hamm dismissed the plaintiff's appeal. The judgment is final; no further appeal was permitted. The court found that there was no concrete danger to the plaintiff’s property, which ultimately led to the dismissal of the claim.\r\n\r\nHowever, the ruling established important legal principles for climate litigation. The court held that major greenhouse gas emitters can, in principle, be held accountable for the impacts of their emissions under German civil law. \r\n\r\nSpecifically, the court found that the plaintiff might potentially have a claim under Section 1004 of the German Civil Code (BGB). If an impairment of property appears imminent, a CO₂ emitter may be obligated to take preventive action. Should the emitter refuse to do so definitively, liability for future costs could be established in advance—based on the emitter’s proportional contribution to global emissions.\r\n\r\nThe court further emphasized that the geographical distance between the defendant’s power plants and the plaintiff’s home in Peru does not, by itself, render the claim unfounded. The presiding judge rejected one of the defendant’s key arguments, clarifying that the court’s reasoning does not open the door to lawsuits against every individual emitter. The emissions of a single person are typically so minor that they do not give rise to liability. Similarly, the defendant cannot invoke its public utility obligations under German law to justify interference with the plaintiff’s property rights abroad.\r\n\r\nThe appeal was dismissed because the evidence demonstrated no concrete or substantial risk to the plaintiff’s property. The likelihood of water from a nearby glacier lake reaching his home within the next 30 years was assessed at only about one percent—a probability the court deemed too low to justify legal intervention. Even if such an event were to occur, the projected flood would reach the house with a height of just a few centimeters and a flow speed insufficient to compromise the building’s structural integrity.",

      "summary": "Vattenfall, an energy firm in which the Swedish government owns a controlling stake, agreed to sell several coal-fired power plants and associated mining assets to the German subsidiary of a Czech holding company. The sale was prompted in part by an environmental review that recommended Swedish divestment from fossil assets. Environmental NGOs and individual plaintiffs challenged the sale as a violation of the Swedish government’s duty of care to its citizens to protect their right to a non-harmful climate. The plaintiffs’ petition grounds this duty in the Swedish Constitution and Sweden’s adoption of several international agreements—the petition thus resembles submission made in the recent Urgenda decision in the Netherlands. The petition argued that the sale would enable the expanded exploitation of lignite coal assets, resulting in emissions in excess of limits that correspond to climate stability. It further noted that Sweden committed to act to avoid breaching those limits. On this basis, the plaintiffs asked the court to declare that 1) the Swedish state has breached its duty of care with the sale, and 2) the sale is illegal. The plaintiffs have also asked the court to order publication of the environmental review conducted in advance of the sale, which the government has so far withheld. \r\n\r\nThe court denied these requests after determining that the plaintiffs had not experienced an injury from the governmental decisions at issue.",

      "count": 1,
      "summary": "A group of plaintiffs who own property along Belongil Beach in New South Wales, Australia sought damages from the local government authority, the Byron Shire Council, to cover the costs of erecting shoreline protections on their parcels and to compensate for lost value to their properties from encroaching seas. Plaintiffs alleged that the need for those protections and the cause of the properties’ partial loss of value was the fault of the Council. In the 1960s and 70s, the Council constructed a form of hard shoreline armoring—“an artificial headland protected by a rock seawall.” Then, between 2006 and 2010, the Council issued draft planning documents (i) prohibiting the plaintiffs from armoring their own segments of shoreline and (ii) proposing a policy of managed retreat in response to rising seas and an encroaching shoreline. The Coastal Protection Act provides that such plans only become final and effective after approval by the New South Wales Minister for Planning; the Council withdrew its draft Coastal Zone Management Plan in May 2011, before the Minister considered it. \r\n\r\nPlaintiffs presented two alternative theories in support of their claim: either that the Council was negligent for installing hard shoreline armoring that has since displaced wave action to plaintiffs’ adjacent portions of beach, worsening erosion there; or that the council’s armoring constitutes an instance of public nuisance. Plaintiffs also argued that their injury was compounded by the Council’s issuance and withdrawal of planning documents, and persistent position that managed retreat is the preferred policy response to shoreline encroachment.\r\n\r\nAfter the plaintiffs’ suit survived a motion to dismiss in March 2016, the Council’s insurers, who had been steering the defense in the case, agreed to a settlement. As a result, the court never determined legal liability for the claims alleged. The settlement’s terms bar the Council from removing existing coastal armoring (chiefly rock, concrete, and rubble barriers) on the plaintiffs’ parcels unless the plaintiffs agree to such removal. Should plaintiffs want to add to that armoring, the must apply within one year of the settlement, dated August 2016, and then must make the requested additions within one year of approval of their application. Any subsequent repairs or additions may only be proposed after 20 years, and the Council has not guaranteed that such proposals would be approved.",

      "summary": "South Africa's High Court was asked to determine whether, under the National Environmental Management Act 107 of 1998, \"relevant\" considerations for environmental review of plans for a new 1200 MW coal-fired Thabametsi Power Project include the project’s impacts on the global climate and the impacts of a changing climate on the project. Notably, the project would operate until about 2060. The court, after observing that the statute does not expressly contemplate climate change, held that such considerations are relevant and that their absence from the environmental review of the project made its approval unlawful. This question came before the court as a result of EarthLife Africa Johannesburg's appeals. The first appeal was submitted to the Minister of Environmental Affairs to challenge the adequacy of the project's environmental review; EarthLife argued that the review was invalid because it largely ignored climate change. The second was submitted to the High Court in Pretoria to challenge the Minister's mealy-mouthed determination that the review was legally valid even though it would have to be supplemented by a climate change analysis because issues related to climate mitigation and adaptation had not \"comprehensively assessed and/or considered.\"\r\n\r\nThe court cited several reasons, including South Africa’s commitments under the Paris Agreement, for its conclusion that climate change is indeed a relevant consideration for the environmental review of the Thabametsi Project. Because the review approved by the minister effectively ignored climate change, the court held it to be legally invalid. \r\n\r\nAfter the decision of the High Court, the Minister of Environmental Affairs reconsidered the permit application in light of a newly finalized climate change impact assessment and again approved of the environmental authorization for the plant on January 30, 2018. The Minister reasoned that while the power plant would have significant GHG emissions and therefore cause climate change impacts, the power generation benefits of the project outweighed the harms. \r\n\r\nOn March 26, 2018, EarthLife Africa and Trustees for the Time Being of the Groundwork Trust challenged the Minister's decision, asking the court to set aside the decision as unlawful for failing to consider site-specific climate change impacts associated with the project.\r\n\r\nOn November 19, 2020, the High Court, pursuant to an agreement between applicants and defendants, issued an order setting aside all governmental authorizations for the coal-fired power plant.

Plaintiff’s petition argues that the Public Trust Doctrine, India’s commitments under the Paris Agreement, and India’s existing environmental laws and climate-related policies oblige greater action to mitigate climate change. It also argues that the term “environment,” as used in the Environment (Protection) Act 1986, necessarily encompasses the climate. \r\n\r\nThe case was brought pursuant to section 2(m) of the National Green Tribunal Act 2010, which authorizes claims that raise “a substantial question relating to the environment.” In addition to those legal provisions, the petition cites the principles of sustainable development, precaution, and intergenerational equity, as well as judicial decisions based on similar legal principles in the Netherlands (Urgenda Foundation v. Kingdom of the Netherlands), Pakistan, (Leghari v. Pakistan), and the U.S. (Juliana v. United States). Pandey argued that she, along with all children and future generations, had the right to a healthy environment under the principle of intergenerational equity. Pandey also argued that climate change affects children disproportionately. Children were more vulnerable to impacts like heat waves, displacement, diseases, and malnutrition. As climate was an inherent part of the environment, she asserted that safeguarding the environment and protecting forests was critical to addressing climate change.\r\n\r\nThe petition notes that India is the third-largest national emitter of greenhouse gases (behind China and the U.S.) and among those countries that are most susceptible to adverse climate change impacts. It identifies 1° degree Celsius or 350ppm of atmospheric carbon dioxide as the critical pair of thresholds for India (and the world) to avoid exceeding for the sake of avoiding severe climatic changes—facts described in the petition as rooted in “[t]he best climate science.” To remedy the alleged injury to the present and future climate, the petition asks the court to order the national government to undertake a variety of measures, including but not limited to inclusion of climate change in the issues considered by environmental impact assessments, preparation of a national greenhouse gas emissions inventory, and preparation of a national carbon budget against which particular projects’ emissions impacts can be assessed.\r\n\r\nOn January 15, 2019, the National Green Tribunal dismissed the case, reasoning that the climate change is already covered in the process of impact assessments under the Environment Protection Act of 1986, and therefore, \"There is no reason to presume that Paris Agreement and other international protocols are not reflected in the policies of the Government of India or are not taken into consideration in granting environment clearances.\"\r\n\r\nThe petitioner has appealed the decision of the NGT before the Supreme Court of India. The Supreme Court has appointed two amici curiae and directed the Union government to file a compilation of all relevant Rules and Regulations concerning Carbon Emissions. On February 21, 2025, the Supreme Court issued notice in the matter and made the following key observations:\r\n\r\n1. While considering that India has ratified and incorporated the UNFCCC and Paris Agreement nationally through various initiatives, court recognises that the enforceability and binding force of these initiatives must be examined.\r\n\r\n2. Court also noted that a meticulous examination of the existing environmental statutes is necessitated “with a view to incorporating climate-centric mandates.”\r\n\r\n3. Court also recognised synchronisation of the institutional framework under various ministries, who are currently “[appear] to be working in silos.” As such, it directed 8 Indian ministries to be impleaded as parties.\r\n\r\nThe next hearing date is March 28, 2025.

By refusing to review the Queensland Supreme Court’s decision in Coast and Country Association of Queensland Inc v. Smith, the High Court of Australia effectively resolved a question about this review process, namely how to interpret the emissions of coal burned by the end-user of Australian coal. Environmentalists have long argued that even though coal emissions are remote from the mine, they should be considered in EIAs because they are a foreseeable result of mining and would not necessarily occur if the coal were not dug out of an Australian mine. The opposing view holds that coal combustion is physically remote from mining operations, that demand rather than supply drives the market for coal (meaning that mining more Australian coal does not necessarily cause more emissions globally), and that the Environmental Protection Act therefore does not require consideration of coal combustion emissions in EIAs for mines. The Coast and Country decision adopts the latter view.\r\n\r\nThe High Court has not, by refusing to review the Supreme Court of Queensland's decision, endorsed that court’s reasoning, but it has indicated that it will not take up cases challenging the conclusion in Coast and Country regarding the proper scope of a mine’s EIA.

Practically, that conclusion means that environmentalists cannot expect to persuade Queensland courts that the Environmental Protection Act 1994 (Qld) requires consideration of whether a new coal mine will increase global greenhouse gas emissions. \r\n\r\nSpecial leave was refused by the High Court of Australia and the Queensland Court of Appeal. \r\n",

The Tribunal decided state policy requiring the assessment and management of wider risks and consequences of the proposed development to the community meant the Applicant must prepare a coastal hazard vulnerability assessment even though Melbourne Water, the referral Authority, did not object to the permit. The Tribunal expressed concern that the subsequent assessment report did not address risks of inland or riverine flooding in addition to coastal flooding, however it refused the permit application on unrelated grounds. \r\nThe same parties again came before the Tribunal after Owen commissioned an assessment. The Tribunal found the assessment inadequate because it had considered only flooding related to coastal hazards and had ignored the risks attendant to riverine flooding, which was also expected to worsen with climate change.\r\n",

      "summary": "This case dealt with the Coffs Harbour City Council’s rejection of Pridel Investments’ application to develop a 39-lot subdivision. The city council’s grounds for rejection included unacceptably high flooding risk, failure to consider various climate change impacts in accordance with state and national coastal and climate policy, and sustainable development principles as required by the local planning program—the Our Living City Settlement Strategy. The court noted that the plans for construction assumed a 100-year lifespan for the subdivision, but relied on several assumptions about how well existing dunes and other features of the location would withstand climate change, noting that the Council’s objections were not dependent on climate change, but rather a current risk that the protective dune and vegetation will be eroded. It also characterized the plan as impermissible “urban sprawl along the coast” and highlighted as a “fatal flaw” the site’s lack of any alternative means of emergency vehicle access to the site.",

      "summary": "Representatives of the Mataatua District Māori Council have filed a claim and supporting memorandum in the Waitangi Tribunal, the forum where disputes over the performance of the Treaty of Waitangi between Māori and the government of New Zealand are heard and resolved. The claimants allege that New Zealand has breached its obligations to Māori by failing to implement policies that will address climate change. Specifically, the claimants allege that the Crown has breached the Treaty of Waitangi by: failing to take adequate steps to ensure that New Zealand bears its fair share of greenhouse gas emissions reductions; setting inadequate emissions reductions targets; continuing to ineffectively address New Zealand's emissions through the New Zealand Emissions Trading Scheme (NZETS); failing to develop policies for reducing greenhouse gas emissions outside of the NZETS; and failing to fulfil its Treaty obligations to consult with Māori over climate change policies.\r\n\r\nUpon learning from the Tribunal Registry that the claim would be heard after 2020, the claimants filed an urgency application requesting an earlier hearing. That application seeks the following forms of relief:\r\n•\ta declaration from the Tribunal that the government has breached its treaty obligations;\r\n•\ta recommendation that New Zealand revise its emissions reduction targets upward to a level that corresponds with keeping the global concentration of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions below 450ppm—the level that corresponds with the 2°C threshold that demarcates a stable climate from a potentially unstable one;\r\n•\ta recommendation that New Zealand adopt different mitigation policies, including the restructuring or replacement of its Emissions Trading Scheme;\r\n•\ta recommendation that New Zealand adopt policies that facilitate adaptation in ways specific to locations and resources relied upon by Māori.\r\n  \r\nIt bases these requests for relief on several points of fact and law. The most basic of these is the relationship between sources of GHG emissions and climate changes, and the relationship between climate change and various adverse impacts on locations and resources relied upon by Māori for physical and cultural purposes. The application also points out that New Zealand’s Nationally Determined Contribution, submitted following the Paris Climate Conference in 2015, committed the country to reduce emissions by 11% relative to 1990 levels by 2030. It contrasts this target with the increase of GHG emissions in New Zealand of 24.1% relative to their 1990 levels by 2015 and the current expectation that they will increase to 30% increase by 2020. Further facts noted in the application include that New Zealand’s government encourages oil and gas exploration, controls an entity that mines coal, and controls another entity that is responsible for much of the recent conversion of forests to dairy farms. Having described the factual basis that links government policies adverse climate impacts, the claimants then point out that provisions of the Waitangi Treaty make the government responsible for the “active protection” of natural resources such as forests and fisheries on behalf of Māori. In characterizing that violation, the claimants quote from the recent decision in Juliana v. United States regarding the public trust doctrine and characterize that reasoning as relevant to their claim.",

      "summary": "Friends of the Irish Environment challenged the Fingal County Council’s decision to issue a five-year extension to the Dublin Airport Authority for their planning permission to construct a new runway. The court declined to grant any of the relief sought by plaintiffs because they failed to assert a viable claim for standing. However, in a historic first, the High Court issued a judgment recognizing “a personal constitutional right to an environment” under the Irish Constitution. Despite finding a lack of standing, the High Court issued a comprehensive review of the merits in anticipation of a future appeal.\r\n\r\nThe High Court declared that, “A right to an environment that is consistent with the human dignity and well-being of citizens at large is an essential condition for the fulfilment of all human rights. It is an indispensable existential right that is enjoyed universally, yet which is vested personally as a right that presents and can be seen always to have presented, and to enjoy protection, under Art. 40.3.1° of the Constitution.” The Court elaborated that this right was not so “Utopian” as to prevent enforcement, but would rather become enforceable once made concrete through the definition and demarcation of specific duties and obligations. The High Court explained that recognizing this previously unenumerated constitutional right was a first step in this process to define and demarcate a right to an environment.\r\n\r\nHowever, the High Court did not find that the Fingal County Council violated this newly recognized right to an environment by extending the planning permission for the runway. The Court explained, “. . . even though the court accepts that members of the [Friends of Irish Environment] enjoy the contended-for constitutional right, and that the [Friends of the Irish Environment] itself has standing as a body corporate, and has a sufficient basis to contend for recognition of that existing but unenumerated constitutional right, the [Friends of the Irish Environment] nevertheless did not have a right to participate in the extension decision under [Section 42 of the Planning and Development Act 2000] (there is no such right of participation) and it has failed to establish that there is, by reference to that section and on the facts presenting, any disproportionate interference with the personal constitutional right to an environment that is consistent with the human dignity and well-being of citizens at large. In truth, the court sees in [Section 42] nothing more than a proper and proportionate legislative interference with the said, ever-present and now expressly recognised personal constitutional right.”\r\n\r\nFurther, the High Court ruled that Friends of the Irish Environment did not fulfill standing requirements under section 42 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, Article 11 of the Consolidated EIA Directive, or the “Aarhus Convention” (i.e. the UNECE Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation in Decision-Making and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters adopted on 25th June 1998 in the Danish city of Aarhus). The High Court found that neither the Planning and Development Act 2000 nor the Consolidated EIA contained requirements for further public participation in granting an extension of a planning permission. Claims concerning the original decision to grant a planning permission in 2007 were deemed impermissible collateral attacks.\r\n\r\nThe Court did not find that the Section 15 of the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015 changed the substance of Section 42 of the Planning and Development Act in a way relevant to the claims of this case. Section 15 creates an obligation that \"A relevant body shall, in the performance of its functions, have regard to . . . the furtherance of the national transition objective, and the objective of mitigating greenhouse gas emissions and adapting to the effects of climate change in the State.\" The High Court said that the Fingal Council would only need to provide reasons if it elected to entirely depart from the objectives of Section 15. The High Court did not believe this this sort of departure was present in the case at hand.\r\n",

      "summary": "Plan B Earth, a charity with the mission to realize the goals of the Paris Agreement on climate change, has filed a climate change lawsuit against the Secretary of State for Business, Energy, and Industrial Strategy (Secretary of State). Plan B Earth is joined in the lawsuit by 11 citizen claimants ranging in age from 9 to 79 who are impacted by climate change in a variety of ways. The claimants allege that the Secretary of State violated the Climate Change Act 2008 (the 2008 Act) and other law by failing to revise a 2050 carbon reduction target in light of new international law and scientific developments.\r\n\r\nOn December 8, 2017, the claimants filed a claim form and a document listing their grounds for judicial review at the High Court of Justice Administrative Court. They note that the 2008 Act set a carbon emissions reduction target for the year 2050 that is at least 80% lower than the aggregate total of the UK’s greenhouse gas emissions in 1990 (the 2050 target). This 2050 target was consistent with limiting average warming to 2 degrees C above pre-industrial levels. The claimants argue that the Secretary of State should make the 2050 target more ambitious to reflect scientific developments since 2008 and the Paris Agreement’s intention to limit average warming to 1.5 degrees C. Under Section 2 of the 2008 Act, the Secretary of State has the authority to revise the target in light of scientific developments and international law. \r\n\r\nClaimants present five grounds for seeking judicial review of the Secretary of State’s failure to revise the 2050 target: (1) it is ultra vires, because it frustrates the legislative purpose of the 2008 Act; (2) it is based on an error of law regarding the objective of the Paris Agreement; (3) it is irrational, because it fails to take into account and / or inappropriately weighs considerations including the risks of global climate change and predictions of future technical innovation; (4) it violates the Human Rights Act 1998; and (5) it breaches the public sector equality duty set out in Section 149 of the Equality Act 2010.\r\n\r\nClaimants seek declaratory relief that the Secretary of State acted unlawfully in violation of his responsibilities under the 2008 Act and a “mandatory order that the Secretary of State revise the 2050 target in accordance with the purpose of the 2008 Act and the UK’s international law obligations, ensuring, at a minimum, that the 2050 target commits the UK to an equitable contribution the Paris Agreement objective and that it conforms to the precautionary principle.” They also seek what other relief the court deems appropriate and costs.\r\n\r\nIn February, 2018, the claimants' application for judicial review was denied on all five grounds. The claimants renewed their application for review. On March 20, 2018, a permission hearing took place at the Royal Courts of Justice in the Strand to determine if the case was strong enough to merit a full hearing. The hearing was adjourned after the Justice decided that the complexity of the issues would require a full-day permission hearing. The Justice also requested a more detailed statement from the Committee on Climate Change, an independent, statutory body established under the Climate Change Act 2008. The Committee is an interested party in the litigation.\r\n\r\nOn July 20, 2018, the High Court found the claims were not arguable and denied permission for the case to proceed. Plan B Earth appealed the decision on multiple grounds, including alleging that the judge misinterpreted Article 2(1)(a)of the Paris Agreement. Appellants argue that the judge incorrectly read this provision to allow for a range of ambition rather than holding the UK for responsible for “[h]olding  the increase  in  the  global  average  temperature  to  well  below  2°C  above  pre-industrial levels and pursuing  efforts  to  limit  the  temperature  increase  to  1.5°C  above  pre-industrial levels.” Accordingly, appellants further argue that the judge incorrectly found the current UK 2050 climate target compatible with the Paris Agreement due to this misinterpretation of required ambition.\r\n\r\nOn January 25, 2019, the Court of Appeal rejected Plan B's appeal of the High Court's denial to hear the case, marking the end of the appeal process. The court concluded that none of the 7 stated grounds had a real prospect of success. The court did not find an error in law in regard to an alleged failure to exercise discretion to amend the 2050 target, nor did the court find that the Secretary of State misunderstood the Paris Agreement or the advice of the Committee on Climate Change. While acknowledging that a governmental response to the need for environmental protection engages human rights in general, the court declined to find that relevant given its other findings that officials exercised proper discretion and understanding of the Paris Agreement and climate-related advice.",

In such a case, the Court would assess whether the respondent State met three types of obligations:\r\n\r\n1.\tObligations to Prevent Environmental Damages:\r\nStates must: A) issue regulations to prevent damages, B) establish contingency plans to minimize the possibility of major environmental accidents, C) mitigate significant damage that has already occurred, and D) carry out environmental impact studies under the conditions indicated by the Court. The Court requires environmental impact studies to address cumulative impacts, allow the participation of interested persons, and respect the traditions and culture of indigenous peoples. These studies must also be conducted by independent entities and occur prior to the activities that they evaluate. \r\n\r\n2.\tObligations to Cooperate: \r\nStates must: A) cooperate in good faith with States and individuals potentially affected by environmental damage, B) notify potentially affected States that a planned activity under their jurisdiction could generate a risk of significant transboundary damages and of environmental emergencies, and C) negotiate in good faith with States potentially affected by significant transboundary harm.\r\n\r\n3.\tObligations to Provide Information, Justice, and Public Participation: \r\nStates must: A) access to information related to possible effects on the environment, B) the opportunity for citizens to publicly participate in making decisions and policies that may affect the environment, and C) access to justice through national courts in regard to their environmental obligations. The Court clarified that persons potentially affected by transboundary damages must have access to justice without discrimination based on their nationality, residence, or the location of the environmental damage.",

      "type": "case",
      "count": 1,
      "summary": "Ten families, including children, from Portugal, Germany, France, Italy, Romania, Kenya, Fiji, and the Swedish Sami Youth Association Sáminuorra, brought an action in the EU General Court seeking to compel the EU to take more stringent greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reductions. Plaintiffs allege that the EU’s existing target to reduce domestic GHG emissions by 40% by 2030, as compared to 1990 levels, is insufficient to avoid dangerous climate change and threatens plaintiffs’ fundamental rights of life, health, occupation, and property.\r\n\r\nThe lawsuit has two major components. First, plaintiffs bring a nullification action, asking the court to declare three EU legal acts as void for failing to set adequate GHG emissions targets. The three EU legal acts are: Directive 2003/87/EC governing emissions from large power generation installations (ETS); regulation 2018/EU on emissions from industry, transport, buildings, agriculture, and etc. (ESR); and regulation 2018/EU on emissions from and removals by land use, land use change, and forestry (LULUCF). Plaintiffs argue that inadequate emissions reductions violate higher order laws that protect fundamental rights to health, education, occupation, and equal treatment as well as provide obligations to protect the environment. These higher rank laws include: the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights (ChFR), the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), and the Paris Agreement. Plaintiffs ask the court to order that the three emissions reductions laws remain in force until improved versions of the Acts can be enacted. Art. 263 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU) is the basis for this procedural action.\r\n\r\nThe second action concerns non-contractual liability. Article 340 of the TFEU provides a mechanism for injunctive relief when three conditions are met: 1) there is an unlawful act by the EU institution(s), 2) the unlawful act is a serious breach of a law that protects individual rights, and 3) there is a sufficient causal link between the breach and the damages.\r\n\r\nDemanded relief is an injunction to compel the EU to set more stringent GHG emissions reductions targets through the existing framework of the ETS, ESR and LULUCF regimes in order to bring the EU into compliance with its legal obligations. Plaintiffs assert this would require a 50%-60% reduction in GHG emissions below 1990 levels by 2030 or whatever level the court finds appropriate. \r\n\r\nThe European General Court did not rule on the merits, but dismissed the case on procedural grounds, finding that the plaintiffs could not bring the case since they are not sufficiently and directly affected by these policies (“direct and individual concern” criterion). The court concluded that the plaintiffs did not have standing to bring the case because climate change affects every individual in one manner or another and case law requires that plaintiffs are affected by the contested act in a manner that is “peculiar to them or by reason of circumstances in which they are differentiated from all other persons, and by virtue of these factors distinguishes them individually.” The court rejected plaintiffs’ argument that the interpretation of the concept of ‘individual concern’ referred to in the fourth paragraph of Article 263 TFEU is not compatible with a fundamental right to effective judicial protection under Article 47 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights. Nor did the court find that plaintiffs could bring the case under the other possible criteria under the fourth paragraph of Article 263 of the TFEU which would require that they were direct addressees of the legislative package in question or they contested a regulatory act that was of direct concern to them.\r\n\r\nThe plaintiffs appealed to the European Court of Justice on July 11, 2019, arguing that the EU General Court erred in concluding that plaintiffs lacked standing under Article 263, and by holding that plaintiffs needed to establish standing under Article 263 in order to bring a claim for non-contractual liability.\r\n\r\nOn March 25, 2021, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) upheld the General Court's order and held the plaintiff's claims inadmissible on standing grounds for failing to demonstrate that they were individually impacted by Europe's climate policy. The ECJ rejected plaintiffs' arguments that the General Court did not take into account the climate harms specific to them. Rather, the ECJ found sufficient the lower court's reasoning that \"the fact that the effects of climate change may be different for one person than they are for another does not mean that, for that reason, there exists standing to bring an action against a measure of general application,\" and that doing so would render standing limitations meaningless. Further, the ECJ rejected the argument that, by invoking an infringement of fundamental rights, the plaintiffs had established standing. \"[T]he appellants’ reasoning, in addition to its generic wording, leads to the conclusion that there is locus standi for any applicant, since a fundamental right is always likely to be concerned in one way or another by measures of general application such as those contested in the present case.\" The ECJ thus dismissed the appeal and ordered plaintiffs to pay costs incurred by the European Parliament and the Council of the EU. \r\n",

Plaintiffs allege that  the Bali Governor violated Environmental Law No.32 of 2009 and international commitments under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change by granting the environmental permits without consideration of the climate impacts of adding two 330 MW coal-fired units to the project.

      "type": "case",
      "count": 1,
      "summary": "The case concerned the legality of the government’s Airport National Policy Statement (“ANPS”), the policy framework adopted under the Planning Act 2008 (“the Planning Act”), which provides in-principle support for Heathrow airport expansion. \r\n\r\nIn February 2020, the Court of Appealed ruled that the ANPS had not been lawfully adopted, as the Government had not considered the Paris Agreement. However, in December 2020 the UK Supreme Court overturned the Court of Appeal’s decision, ruling that the Government’s ANPS was produced lawfully. Due to this, developers are now able to apply for development consent (planning permission) to expand Heathrow Airport. The judgment makes clear, however, that full climate considerations must be taken into account at the planning permission stage meaning that there are still phases left to satisfy before the runway can actually be built. To date, no application for planning permission has been made.\r\n\r\nIn August 2018, Friends of the Earth England, Wales and Northern Ireland (FoE EWNI) and Plan B Earth (Plan B; a British non-profit with the mission to realize the goals of the Paris Agreement on climate change), filed separate legal claims against the Secretary of State for Transport, Chris Grayling, (“the Secretary of State”) alleging inadequate consideration of climate change impacts in regards to the ANPS. Additional claimants also brought legal challenges, including some local authorities and the NGO Greenpeace, but it was Plan B and FoE EWNI who took the lead on the climate-related claims. Additionally, Heathrow Airport Limited (HAL) and Arora Holdings Limited (Arora) defended the decision to adopt the ANPS as interested parties.  \r\n\r\nFoE ENWI relied on section 10 of the Planning Act in their arguments against the Government. Section 10 requires that the adoption or review of a national policy statement must be a done in a way that contributes to sustainable development, and that  particular regard is had to the desirability of  mitigating the effects of climate change. FoE EWNI’s four grounds were that the Secretary of State had:\r\n•\tfailed to consider the UK’s commitments to the Paris Agreement; \r\n•\tfailed to consider the non-CO2 warming impacts of aviation; \r\n•\tFailed to consider the climate impacts of the expansion beyond the current 2050 reduction UK target as set by the Climate Change Act 2008; and\r\n•\tNot complied with the EC Council Directive 2001/42/EC (“the Strategic Environmental Assessment Directive; as implemented through the SEA Regulations”). \r\n\r\nPlan B argued that the Government’s commitment to the Paris Agreement was already part of government policy, and therefore that the Government had breached section 5(8) of the Planning Act. Under section 5(8), the Secretary of State must include an explanation of how the ANPS considers Government policy to mitigate and adapt to the effects of climate change. \r\n\r\nIn May 2019, the case went before the Divisional Court (with two judges; a High Court Judge and a senior judge). The court dismissed all the claims, including those filed by FoE EWNI and Plan B. \r\n\r\nThe claimants appealed, and the case was heard by the Court of Appeal in October 2019. In February 2020, the Court of Appeal reversed the decision of the Divisional Court, unanimously agreeing with both FoE EWNI and Plan B on all their grounds. The appeals brought by the other parties, such as the local authorities, were dismissed.  \r\n\r\nIn their judgement the Court recognised that, “the legal issues are of the highest importance … Both the development itself and its effects will last well into the second half of the century,” (Court of Appeal judgment, para. 277).\r\nThe court concluded that the Government commitment’s to the Paris Agreement formed a part of “Government policy” by the time the ANPS was prepared. The Secretary of State, as a result, needed to expressly consider and address the Paris Agreement when adopting the ANPS. \r\n\r\nThe court held that by failing to consider the Paris Agreement, the Secretary of State breached the Planning Act on the basis of s.5(8) (Plan B’s ground) and s.10 (FoE EWNI’s ground). The failure to consider the non-CO2 warming impacts, or to consider the climate impacts beyond 2050 were further breaches of s.10 (FoE EWNI’s grounds). Furthermore, its failure to consider the Paris Agreement in the strategic environmental assessment meant that it had also breached the SEA Directive (FoE EWNI’s ground).\r\n\r\nThe Court therefore concluded that the ANPS was of no legal effect and must be reviewed so that the legal errors could be corrected. In response, the Government stated that it would not challenge this decision. \r\n\r\nIn February 2020, HAL and Arora–(the two commercial entities, which were interested parties in the case) applied for permission to appeal to the Supreme Court. In May 2020, the Supreme Court agreed to hear the appeal. Arora subsequently withdrew, so when the case went before the Supreme Court for the substantive hearing in October 2020, the sole appellant was HAL. The Government did not participate in the appeal. FoE EWNI and Plan B were the respondents to the appeal and defended the decision by the Court of Appeal. HAL’s appeal challenged the Court of Appeal’s ruling in relation to all four grounds argued by FoE EWNI, and Plan B’s s.5(8) ground. In December 2020, the Supreme Court overturned the Court of Appeal’s decision in full. The judgments conclusions in relation to FoE EWNI’s grounds were as follows:\r\n\r\nFirstly, the Secretary of State had a broad discretion on what to consider in terms of mitigating the effects of climate change through sustainable development under section 10 of the Planning Act. The Supreme Court held that the Secretary of State had acted lawfully, and to the extent that he needed to consider the Paris Agreement, had done so through consideration of the emission reduction commitments in the Climate Change Act 2008. \r\n\r\nSecondly, the SEA conducted was lawful, and did not need to expressly refer to the Paris Agreement. Full consideration to climate matters would take place at the stage of applying for planning permission.   \r\n\r\nThirdly and fourthly, the Secretary did not act irrationally in excluding post-2050 and non-CO2 emissions. There was uncertainty over the quantification of non-CO2 impacts, and both these and post 2050 emissions could be considered at the planning stage. \r\n\r\nIn relation to Plan B’s ground, the Supreme Court found that the Paris Agreement itself did not constitute government policy under section 5(8) of the Planning Act, giving the term in the legislation a “relatively narrow meaning,” (UK Supreme Court judgment at para.10).\r\n\r\nAs there is no onward appeal from the UK Supreme Court, this case cannot be taken further. The ANPS has therefore been reinstated with full legal effect, so that a developer can now apply for planning permission for the expansion of Heathrow airport. Details of the implications of the judgement are included in the Friends of the Earth briefing. \r\n",

      "summary": "On November 2, 2020, the parties reached a settlement where the Australian pension fund agreed to incorporate climate change financial risks in its investments and implement a net-zero by 2050 carbon footprint goal. More on the settlement below. \r\n\r\nAn Australian pension fund member filed suit against the Retail Employees Superannuation Trust (REST) alleging that the fund violated the Corporations Act 2001 by failing to provide information related to climate change business risks and any plans to address those risks. The case was filed in the Federal Court of Australia in July 2018.\r\n\r\nThe plaintiff, Mark McVeigh has contributed to REST since 2013. Under the Corporations Act 2001, super fund beneficiaries are entitled to request information that they need to make an informed decision about the management and financial condition of the fund. The plaintiff requested information from REST regarding the: “(a) knowledge of REST’s Climate Change Business Risks; (b) opinion of Climate Change, the Physical Risks, the Transition Risks and REST’s Climate Change Business Risks; (c) actions responding to REST’s Climate Change Business Risks; and (d) compliance with its obligations under the Corporations Act and other law with respect to REST’s Climate Change Business Risks.” The first complaint alleges that the information provided by REST did not fulfill its obligations and thus seeks declaratory relief that REST violated the Corporations Act by failing to disclose the requested information and an injunction requiring REST to provide that information. In the alternative, plaintiff seeks a declaration and injunction in equitable jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nIn September 2018 plaintiff filed an amended complaint, alleging, in addition to the claims listed above, that REST has violated the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 (SIS Act). The SIS Act requires trustees to act with care, skill, and diligence, and to perform their duties and exercise their powers in the best interests of their beneficiaries. The amended complaint alleges that a prudent superannuation trustee would have, among other things, required its investment managers to provide the type of information that McVeigh requested regarding climate change; and ensure that its processes for managing investments and disclosing climate change business risks to beneficiaries complied with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-Related Financial Disclosures. \r\n\r\nIn January 2019 the court issued an order on plaintiff's application for maximum costs, which is a mechanism to allow individuals bringing cases in the public interest to avoid legal costs. The court concluded that, \"the case appears to raise a socially significant issue about the role of superannuation trusts and trustees in the current public controversy about climate change. It is legitimate to describe the Applicant’s litigation as being of a public interest nature.\" However, the court determined that more information was needed about plaintiff's ability to proceed if his application was denied. The parties later resolved the issue among themselves.\r\n\r\nBefore the trial was set to begin, the REST reached a settlement with the plaintiff and set out the details of the settlement in a press release. REST acknowledged that \"Climate change is a material, direct and current financial risk to the superannuation fund across many risk categories, including investment, market, reputational, strategic, governance and third-party risks.\" To address this risk, Rest agreed to implement a net-zero carbon footprint by 2050 goal for the fund, to measure, monitor and report climate progress in line with the Task Force on Climate-related Disclosures, to ensure investee climate disclosure, and to publicly disclose portfolio holdings, among other commitments.

      "summary": "On October 11, 2019, the Superior Court of Ontario dismissed Greenpeace's case on the grounds that declaratory relief was not available. Two of the three judges reasoned that declaratory relief would have no practical effect because the statute that gave authority for the regulation at issue had been repealed. Had declaratory relief been able to have practical effect, two of the judges would have found that the Ontario government was required to participate in public participation before enacting the cancelling regulation.\r\n\r\nPrior to the dismissal, on January 25, 2019, the court rejected a motion to dismiss on the grounds that the dispute was moot, reasoning that there was still a live dispute over whether the public participation in question was lawful. \r\n\r\nEnvironmental groups filed suit against the Ontarian government, alleging the government failed to meet legal requirements for public consultation on regulations that would end Ontario’s cap and trade program and a proposed bill that would undercut the province’s legislative regime for combatting climate change. Plaintiffs argued that both the regulations and bill violate requirements under the Environmental Bill of Rights (EBR) for public participation in the development of environmentally significant regulations and legislation. \r\n\r\nThe lawsuit concerns Ontario Regulation 386/18 filed on July 3, 2018 by the Minister of Environment, Conservation and Parks. The government did not conduct a public consultation process and filed a claim that the 2018 election was “substantially equivalent” to the 30-day consultation process required by law. Plaintiffs argued that the government was still required to undertake public consultation for the regulation under the EBR and that the regulation is ultra vires because it contradicts the purpose of the “Climate Change Mitigation and Low-Carbon Economy Act,” the enabling act for this regulation. The lawsuit additionally concerned “Bill 4, the Cap and Trade Cancellation Act, 2018” filed on July 25, 2018. This bill would repeal the “Climate Change Mitigation and Low-carbon Economy Act, 2016” which includes greenhouse gas emission reduction targets. Plaintiffs argued that this bill would have a significant environmental impact because it would repeal existing greenhouse gas emissions targets without establishing new targets. If there is a significant environmental impact, then the government must undertake the mandatory notice and comment process required by the EBR. \r\n\r\nPlaintiffs sought declaratory relief and asked the Court to quash the regulations.\r\n",

      "summary": "ClientEarth, a non-profit environmental law organization and shareholder in the Polish utility Enea SA, has sued that company, seeking the annulment of a resolution consenting to construction of the €1.2bn 1GW Ostrołęka C coal-fired power plant. The claim is brought under the Polish Commercial Companies Code. The plaintiffs report that the lawsuit claims the consent resolution for construction of the power plant harms the economic interests of the company as a result of climate-related financial risks, including: rising carbon prices, increased competition from cheaper renewables, and the impact of EU energy reforms on state subsidies for coal power under the capacity market. On September 19, 2018, in advance of filing the pleadings, plaintiffs’ lawyers wrote to Enea stating that ClientEarth regarded “the proposed resolution, and the Management Board’s proposal of that resolution, as clearly and obviously harmful to the interests of Enea and its shareholders” and warned that Enea’s ongoing actions in relation to the plant “risk breaching board members’ fiduciary duties of due diligence and to act in the best interests of the company and its shareholders.” The claim was filed on October 24, 2018 in the Regional Court in Poznań (Sąd Okręgowy w Poznaniu). \r\n\r\nOn August 1, 2019, the court found the company resolution authorizing construction of the power plant to be legally invalid. Further discussion of the reasoning will be added to this profile upon review of a translation of the full decision.\r\n\r\nDuring the extraordinary general meeting of shareholders of the respondent company, resolution giving its directional consent to commence the construction phase of the  project of building coal-fired power station (1 GW) in Ostrołęka, Poland. \r\n\r\nIn the opinion of the Poznań Regional Court, the contested resolution encroaches upon the powers of the company's management board to manage its affairs, exceeding, in this respect, the powers of the general meeting and, at the same time, constitutes a binding instruction for the management board to manage the company's affairs. With the facts thus established, the Regional Court firstly pointed out that, pursuant to Article 425 § 1 of the Commercial Companies Code (CCC) a resolution of the shareholders' meeting of a joint-stock company may be declared invalid if the resolution is contrary to the law. In the opinion of the Poznań Regional Court, the plaintiff's claims are justified, in particular as regards the contradiction of the appealed resolution with Article 368 § 1 of the CCC, Article 3751 of the CCC and Article 384 of the CCC. According to the principles of organisation and functioning of a joint-stock company, it operates through its organs, which are the management board, the supervisory board and the general meeting. Each of these bodies may act within the limits of its powers under the law and the articles of association. In particular, the statutory body appointed and authorised to manage the company's affairs and represent it externally is the board of directors. For these reasons, the Poznań Regional Court declared the resolution invalid.\r\n\r\nThe judgment in question was appealed to the Appellate Court in Poznań, 1st Civil Division and Intellectual Property Division, which dismissed the appeal by judgment of 8 July 2020.\r\n\r\nAspects strictly related to climate change were part of the arguments in the ClientEarth Foundation's claim, but they were not the warp of the judgment. The Regional Court in Poznań based its ruling solely on the formal aspects of the adoption of the resolution and the fact that the extraordinary general meeting of shareholders exceeded the powers granted to this body by the Commercial Companies Code.  As a result of the court's invalidation of this resolution, the investor abandoned the project to build a coal-fired power station in Ostrołęka. ",

ENvironnement JEUnesse reports that it has asked the Court, inter alia, to declare that the Government of Canada has failed in its obligations to protect the fundamental rights of young people under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and the Québec Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The organization alleges that the government violated plaintiffs’ rights by setting a greenhouse gas reduction target insufficient to avoid dangerous climate change impacts and by lacking an adequate plan to reach its greenhouse gas emission target. \r\n\r\nMore specifically, plaintiffs allege that 1) the “Canadian government's adoption of GHG emission targets that it knows are harmful to human life and health violates the right of class members to life, inviolability and security protected by section 7 of the Canadian Charter and section 1 of the Québec Charter,” and 2) “by adopting inadequate targets and failing to put in place the necessary measures to achieve these targets, the government is violating the class members' right to live in a healthful environment in which biodiversity is preserved, protected by the Québec Charter.” \r\n\r\nThe class action seeks a declaratory judgment and punitive damages.

The judge concluded that the impact of climate change on human rights is a justiciable issue and that the Canadian Charters and Quebec rights and freedoms can apply to government actions in this area. However, the judge declined to authorize the proposed class, determining that the 35-year age cut-off was arbitrary and not objective. Environment JEUnesse appealed the decision on August 16.\r\n\r\nOn December 13th, 2021, the Quebec Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal on justiciability and denied the certification of the proposed climate change class action suit. The Court found that “all the alleged facts” accuse the Canadian government of a “fault of omission” resulting from its inaction in the face of global warming. Conclusions sought by the Appellants are tantamount to asking the courts to tell the legislature what to do, which is not their role. It held that deference to the legislative power is “necessary” as it is better placed to weigh the countless challenges of global warming. The Court did not weigh in on the allegation that government actions were contributing to climate change and therefore violated the Charter rights. The Court also objected to the lack of specificity of the remedy requested and agreed with the trial judge that the proposed class was arbitrary since the theory of the case on age discrimination was not acceptable. \r\n\r\nENvironnement Jeunesse filed an application for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada on February 11, 2022.

The Secretary called the application in for his own determination and after a public inquiry declined to grant permission for the project, giving considerable weight in his decision-making to the adverse effects of greenhouse gas emissions. H. J. Banks & Co. Ltd challenged the denial on two grounds. The first ground alleged an error in the Secretary’s interpretation of balancing considerations under paragraph 149 of the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF). The second ground alleged that the Secretary wrongly weighed greenhouse gas emissions resulting from burning coal at power plants and that the Secretary acted inconsistently with previous practice in how the Secretary considered these emissions.\r\n\r\nThe High Court quashed the decision on grounds one and two. On ground one, the High Court determined that the Secretary had not lawfully weighed the relative costs and benefits of tourism and biodiversity as required under the balancing test of paragraph 149 of the NPPF and related regulations. On ground two, the High Court found that the Secretary provided insufficient reasoning to explain why emissions would be reduced if the coal project was denied because there was not adequate explanation of how power generation would be replaced by less carbon-intensive sources rather than imported coal. The Court found that the Secretary provided inadequate reasoning for how national policy to decarbonize was inconsistent with granting the permission.\r\n",

On March 14, 2019, the plaintiffs initiated the lawsuit by filing a \"summary request\" before the Administrative Court of Paris. The plaintiffs request that the State of France be enjoined to remedy its inadequate action on climate change. Specifically, they request the court to order France to: \r\n\r\n1.\tTake proper measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere - in due proportion considering global emissions, and taking into account the particular responsibility accepted by developed countries - at a level compatible with the objective to contain the rise of the average temperature of the planet below the threshold of 1.5 °C compared to pre-industrial levels; \r\n2.\tTake, at least, all necessary measures to achieve France's targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, developing renewable energies and increasing energy efficiency; \r\n3.\tTake the necessary measures to adapt the national territory to the effects of climate change; \r\n4.\tTake the necessary measures to protect citizens’ lives and health from the risks of climate change. \r\n\r\nThey further request compensation for the damages suffered as a result of the State’s failure to tackle climate change to be paid as “the symbolic sum of 1 euro for their moral prejudice.” \r\n \r\nAccording to a translation of the legal request, plaintiffs argue that the government has both general and specific legal duties to act on climate change. Its general duties stem from 1) the French Charter for the Environment (“the Charter”), the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (ECPHR), and 3) the general principle of law providing the right of every person to live in a preserved climate system. Under the Charter, plaintiffs point to citizens’ constitutional rights to live in a healthy and ecologically balanced environment and argue the government has a duty of care to “take all necessary measures to identify, avoid, reduce and compensate the consequences of climate change.” Like other recent international cases, they point to further obligations of the state to act on climate change to uphold the rights guaranteed under Articles 2 & 8 of the ECPHR, respectively “the right to life” and the “right to respect for private and family life.” They argue that these rights require States “to implement a legislative and regulatory framework and to adopt practical measures meant to fight efficiently against climate change.” \r\n\r\nPlaintiffs further base their claims on a  “general principle of law” providing a right to a “preserved climate system” which they argue stems from national law (such as the preamble of the Charter for the Environment, article L. 110-1 of the French Environment Code, etc.) and international law (the Stockholm Declaration, the World Charter for Nature, the Rio Declaration, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the Kyoto protocol, the Paris Agreement, the Climate action and renewable energy package for 2020, the Decision n°406/2009/CE of the European Parliament and of the Council dated 23 April 2009). Plaintiffs additionally argue the State has further “specific” obligations to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions under EU and national law as well as specific obligations to take action to prepare for the impacts of climate change on France.\r\n\r\nOn June 23, 2020 the government responded. According to the plaintiffs, the government asserted that it was taking action to address greenhouse gas emissions, and that the time has not elapsed for it to meet its 2020 goals. \r\n\r\nThe case was heard in court on January 14, 2020. At the hearing the public rapporteur (independant consultant judge who provides an opinion to help guide the court's decision) issued an opinion. According to the plaintiffs, the opinion urged the court to recognize the fault of the French government, to recognize climate change as pure ecological damage, to award damages of one euro for moral prejudice, but to stop short of issuing an injunction because past damage cannot be repaired.\r\n\r\nOn February 3, 2021, the Administrative Court of Paris issued a decision recognizing that France's inaction has caused ecological damage from climate change and awarded the plaintiffs the requested one euro for moral prejudice caused by this inaction. The Court deferred the decision on whether to issue an injunction to order the French government to take stronger climate measures, and ordered the government to disclose steps it was taking to meet its climate targets within two months. As part of the decision, the Court held that France could be held responsible for failing to meet its own climate and carbon budget goals under EU and national law. But the Court rejected arguments that the government could be forced to meet more specific renewable energy and energy efficiency targets on the grounds that such sectoral measures cannot be independently directly linked to ecological damage. Further, the Court declined to issue compensatory damages for ecological harm, as the Court found that the plaintiffs had not shown that the government will be unable to repair the harm caused. \r\n\r\nOn October 14, 2021, the administrative court of Paris ordered the State to take immediate and concrete actions to comply with its commitments on cutting carbon emissions and repair the damages caused by its inaction by December 31, 2022. The court determined that France emitted 62 million extra tonnes of emissions from 2015-2018, though it lowered the amount to 15 million tonnes, taking into account the drop in emissions in 2020. The court thus called on France to subtract the emissions caused in excess of its legislative commitments, adding these to the reduction of emissions planned between 2021 and 2022. France has committed to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of 40 percent by 2030, compared to 1990 levels, and to reaching carbon neutrality by 2050. Any future slippage of emissions beyond the legislative commitments must also be compensated. The court rejected a request to have France to pay 78 million euros per semester of delay in meeting the emissions goals, and said it is up to the Prime minister and the government to come up with the measures to fix the problem.\r\n\r\nIn December 2023, the Administrative Court of Paris ruled that the State had complied with the 2021 judgment because the surplus of greenhouse gas emissions had been compensated, albeit with a one-year delay. \r\n\r\nTherefore, the plaintiff NGOs appealed to the Council of State requesting that it examine the execution of the 2021 ruling in light of these parameters—in line with the renewed condemnation of the State in May 2023 (https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/commune-de-grande-synthe-v-france/).\r\n\r\nOn May 21, 2024, the plaintiff NGOs submitted their brief to the Council of State. The organizations argue that the Administrative Court of Paris neither took the time nor the resources necessary to properly examine the implementation of the 2021 judgment, denying them the right to a fair trial.",

      "count": 1,
      "summary": "The Province of Ontario filed suit in the Ontario Court of Appeal seeking consideration of whether the Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act (GGPPA) is unconstitutional. The GGPPA became law in June 2018 and, as its name implies, allows the national government to set a price on greenhouse gas emissions which will be applied to provinces and territories that have not implemented a compliant program once the law goes into effect in January 2019. Ontario alleged that Parliament exceeded its constitutional authority in passing the GGPPA, arguing that the GGPPA is not authorized by the “national concern branch of the peace, order, and good government power” because the provinces are capable of regulating greenhouse gas emissions themselves and that “there is no need to expand the scope of federal jurisdiction to impose a one-size-fits-all federal carbon price.” Ontario further argues that even if the GGPPA falls within the scope of a national concern, the GGPPA represents an unconstitutional tax because it does not provide an adequate nexus between the charges it imposes and its regulatory purpose.  \r\n\r\nMultiple parties have intervened in the case, including a number of advocacy groups and the governments of Saskatchewan, New Brunswick, and British Columbia.\r\n\r\nOn June 28, 2019, the court upheld the constitutionality of the GGPPA. This decision marks the second decision among four provincial cases challenging the constitutionality of the GGPPA and the federal carbon pricing regime. The court determined that the GGPPA was constitutional under Parliament’s power over matters of national concern to the peace, order, and good government of Canada. The court characterized the GGPPA as validly “establishing minimum national standards to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.” This is broader than the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal’s characterization of the GGPPA as validly “establishing minimum national GHG emissions pricing standards to reduce GHG emissions.”  The Court of Appeal for Ontario also upheld both the large emitters output-based performance system (Part 2 of the Act), and the fuel levies (Part 1 of the Act), which it construed as a regulatory charge rather than a tax.

      "type": "case",
      "count": 1,
      "summary": "An advocacy group, Friends of the Irish Environment (FIE), filed suit in the High Court, arguing that the Irish government’s approval of the National Mitigation Plan in 2017 violated Ireland’s Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015 (\"the Act\"), the Constitution of Ireland, and obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights, particularly the right to life and the right to private and family life. FIE alleged that the National Mitigation Plan (\"the Plan\"), which seeks to transition to a low-carbon economy by 2050, is inconsistent with the Act and Ireland's human rights commitments because it is not designed to achieve substantial short-term emissions reductions. The case was argued before the High Court on January 22, 2019. FIE asked the High Court to quash the government's decision to approve the Plan and, if appropriate, order that a new plan be written.  \r\n\r\nOn September 19, 2019, the Court ruled for the government.  The Court rejected FEI's claim that the Plan was invalid for failing to achieve substantial short-term emissions reductions, concluding that the Act does not require particular intermediate targets.  The Court recognized that \"there is now limited room, or . . . carbon budget, for greenhouse gas emissions\" given the \"safe temperature rise target\" of 1.5 degrees Celsius.  The Court reasoned, however, that the government appropriately exercised policy making discretion afforded by the Act, explaining that the current Plan is only an initial step in achieving targets for transitioning to a low-carbon, climate resilient, and environmentally sustainable economy by 2050, and will be subject to review and revision.  The Court concluded that FEI had standing to bring rights-based claims, but rejected the argument that the government had violated Ireland's Constitution and commitments under the European Convention on Human Rights because the Plan is \"but one, albeit extremely important, piece of the jigsaw.\" \r\n\r\nOn November 22, 2019, FEI appealed the ruling to the Court of Appeal. FEI also submitted an application to leapfrog the traditional appeal route and go directly to the Supreme Court.  On February 13, 2020 the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case, determining that exceptional circumstances warranted direct appeal.  The Court explained that, \"[t]he applicant and the respondents accept that there exists a degree of urgency in respect of the adoption of remedial environmental measures.  There is no dispute between the parties as to the science underpinning the Plan and the likely increase in greenhouse emissions over the lifetime of the Plan.\"\r\n\r\nOn July 31, 2020, the Supreme Court reversed the lower court and issued a ruling quashing the National Mitigation Plan (2017) under the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015. The Court determined that the Plan fell short of the sort of specificity that the Act required because a reasonable reader of the Plan would not understand how Ireland would achieve its 2050 goals. The Court explained that \"a compliant plan must be sufficiently specific as to policy over the whole period to 2050.\" The Court emphasized transparency and public participation as statutory goals, noting the public must be able to assess and critique the government’s plan effectively. The Court rejected the Government’s argument that the Plan was a purely political or policy document and therefore non-justiciable. Since the Plan was adopted under legislation, the Court held it was subject to judicial review to ensure compliance with statutory obligations. The Court applied a standard based on statutory compliance, emphasizing that while policy choices fall within government discretion, they must still comply with legal obligations. It reaffirmed the importance of specificity and coherence in plans adopted under statute.\r\n\r\nThe Court found that Friends of the Irish Environment had standing to challenge the Plan, given the importance of the environmental rights at stake and FIE’s role as an environmental watchdog.\r\n\r\nThe Court also concluded that FIE had not made a compelling enough case for identifying an unenumerated right to a healthy environment, separate from the rights expressly conferred by the Irish Constitution, \"[w]hile not ruling out the possibility that constitutional rights and obligations may well be engaged in the environmental field in an appropriate case.\" The Court declined to rule on the constitutional or ECHR rights arguments (right to life, bodily integrity, etc.). Since the Plan was already found ultra vires, there was no need to resolve the broader constitutional or human rights questions in this case.",

      "count": 1,
      "summary": "On December 19, 2017, Gloucester Resources Limited sued the Minister of Planning, appealing the denial of the company’s application to construct an open cut coal mine in New South Wales, the Rocky Hill Coal Project, which proposed to produce 21 million tonnes of coal over a period of 16 years. The Land & Environment Court of New South Wales upheld the government’s denial of the application. The court found that the project was not in the public interest after weighing costs and benefits of the project, including the climate change impacts of the mine’s direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions. Under Section 4.15(1) of the Environmental Planning & Assessment Act (the EPA), the government is to consider the public interest as part of its review of a development application.\r\n\r\nThe Department of Planning denied the Rocky Hill Coal Project application in December 2017. After Gloucester Resources Limited appealed the decision, a local community action group called Gloucester Groundswell Inc. was joined to the litigation. The Minister and Groundswell argued that the Rocky Hill Project application should be denied due to the: \r\n1) incompatibility of the proposed mine with the existing, approved and likely preferred uses of nearby land; \r\n2) the adverse visual impacts of the mine; \r\n3) the adverse social impacts of the mine; \r\n4) the uncertainty surrounding the economic and public benefits of the mine which were not shown to be greater than the public costs of the mine; and \r\n5) the Rocky Hill Coal Project is not in the public interest because of the matters in (1) to (4) above and “it is contrary to the principles of ecologically sustainable development because the direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions of the mine will contribute to climate change.”\r\n\r\nAs part of its consideration of climate change impacts, the court held that both upstream and downstream emissions of the project should be considered by the Planning Department because the EPA and its regulations require consideration of “the principles of ecologically sustainable development” (“ESD”) which can encompass climate change impacts. The court also pointed to the requirements under the EPA to consider “any environmental planning instrument” and cited language in the State Environmental Planning Policy (Mining, Petroleum Production and Extractive Industries) of 2009 and the 2010 Gloucester Local Environmental Plan as including consideration of ESD and the cumulative greenhouse gas emissions associated with a project. The court recognized the link between these emissions and climate change, remaining unpersuaded by petitioner’s arguments related to market substitution, carbon leakage, the theoretical possibility that other projects would offset these emissions, and the inefficiency of this denial as a mechanism for global abatement of emissions. \r\n\r\nAfter weighing the costs and benefits of the project, the court upheld the government’s denial of the application, finding “that the negative impacts of the Project, including the planning impacts on the existing, approved and likely preferred land uses, the visual impacts, the amenity impacts of noise and dust that cause social impacts, other social impacts, and climate change impacts, outweigh the economic and other public benefits of the Project.” While not foreclosing all mining projects, the court ruled that this project was not a “sustainable use” because of the combination of climate change impacts of the project and the high environmental and social costs of locating a coal mine in this particular location. \r\n\r\nGloucester Resources Limited did not file an appeal by the court-designated deadline of May 8, 2019.\r\n",

RED II requires EU Member States to achieve an EU-wide target of 32% energy consumption from renewable sources by 2030. The plaintiffs allege that RED II will accelerate widespread forest devastation and significantly increase greenhouse gas emissions by not counting CO2 emissions from burning wood fuels. \r\n\r\nPlaintiffs describe the lawsuit as documenting the environmental, societal, and public health impacts associated with the increased logging, wood pellet manufacturing, and production of biomass energy driven by the RED II forest biomass policy.

      "summary": "By three letters dated November 19, 2018, the municipality of Grande-Synthe and its mayor asked the President of the Republic, the Prime Minister, the Minister of State, and the Minister of Ecological Transition and Solidarity to (i) take any useful measure to bend the curve of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions produced on the national territory to respect the obligations agreed by France; (ii) take all legislative or regulatory initiatives to \"make climate priority mandatory\" and to prohibit any measure likely to increase GHG emissions, and (iii) implement immediate measures to adapt to climate change in France. They did not receive any answer from the public authorities. \r\n\r\nTherefore, on January 23, 2019, they sued the French government and requested the Council of State to annul for excess of power the implicit decisions of rejection resulting from the silence kept by the President of the Republic, the Prime Minister and the Minister of State, Minister of Ecological Transition and Solidarity, on their requests, and to order them to (i) take all necessary measures to curb the curve of GHG emissions produced on the national territory to respect at least the commitments agreed by France at the international and national levels; (ii) implement immediate measures to adapt to climate change in France, and (iii) take all necessary legislative and regulatory initiatives to \"make climate change a priority\" and prohibit any measure likely to increase GHG emissions. The suit was filed before the Council of State (Conseil d'Etat), the highest administrative court in France, which has jurisdiction to review a decision within the general regulatory power of the government. Plaintiffs stressed the particular vulnerability of Grande-Synthe to the impacts of climate change as a low-lying coastal municipality exposed to sea level rise and flooding. \r\n\r\nOn November 19, 2020, the Council of State ruled that the case was admissible. According to the Court, the coastal communities' claims are admissible in part because the city is particularly exposed to the effects of climate change. The Court also accepted interventions by NGOs and other interested cities. The Court then noted that France committed itself to a 40% reduction in GHG emissions by 2030, compared to 1990 levels, and instructed the government to justify its ability to meet this goal without stricter measures. Although the Court signalled that the decision would be driven by French and European law and not the Paris Agreement, the Court reasoned that the Paris Agreement must be considered in the interpretation of national law. In this respect, the objective of reducing GHG emissions by 40% between 1990 and 2030 set out in Article L. 100-4 of the Energy Code, which expressly mentions the UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement, is intended to ensure, as far as France is concerned, the effective implementation of the principles set out in international law. Moreover, the Court stated that the fact that the executive branch refrains from submitting a bill to Parliament concerns the relationship between the constitutional public authorities and is therefore outside the jurisdiction of the administrative court. On the other hand, it affirmed that it did not have all the necessary elements to assess the situation in order to state on the claim concerning the annulment of the implicit refusal to take any useful measure enabling the curve of GHG emissions produced on the national territory to be curbed and the related injunction to curb the emissions and instructed the government to justify, within three months, that it was taking adequate actions towards meeting its own 2030 climate goals. \r\n\r\nThe Council of State issued the final decision on July 1, 2021. It ordered the government to \"take all the measures necessary\" by the end of March 2022 to bend the curve of GHG emissions to meet climate goals, including a 40% reduction by 2030. The Court annulled the government's implicit refusal to take necessary measures, noting that the emissions decrease in 2019 and 2020 were not enough to ensure compliance with the required climate goals, and current climate regulations were insufficient to meet the target. \r\n\r\nThe procedure concerning the evaluation of the implementation of the measures necessary to comply with the decision of the Council of State is currently ongoing.

      "type": "case",
      "count": 1,
      "summary": "In April of 2018, the Province of Saskatchewan filed a reference case with the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan, asking whether the Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act (GGPPA) was an unconstitutional intrusion into provincial jurisdiction. The GGPPA was introduced into Parliament on March 28, 2018 as Part 5 of Bill C-74 and became law on June 21, 2018. It established a federal price on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, effective as of January 2019, in any province or territory that has not implemented a compliant carbon pricing regime or any province or territory that requests it. The Paris Agreement was among the laws discussed in the preamble of the GGPPA in regard to the need for a carbon pricing mechanism. On May 3, 2019, the Court of Appeal for Saskatchewan ruled that the (GGPPA) is constitutional in whole or in part by a 3-2 majority.\r\n\r\nThe Court of Appeal rejected Canada’s broader argument that Parliament has jurisdiction over “the cumulative dimensions of GHG emissions” under the national concern branch of its “Peace, Order, and good Government” [POGG] power. The Court found this approach would exceed the constitutional authority of Parliament and intrude too far into areas of Provincial authority and limit Provincial efforts to deal with GHG emissions. However, the Court did rule that Parliament has more narrow authority under the POGG to establish “minimum national standards of price stringency for GHG emissions” because this authority “has the singleness, distinctiveness and indivisibility required by the law.” Accordingly, the Court ruled that the GGPPA is constitutionally valid under this more narrow POGG authority.\r\n\r\nThe Attorney General for Saskatchewan appealed the decision to the Supreme Court of Canada. In similar cases, the Court of Appeal of Ontario had also ruled the Act constitutional, while the Court of Appeal of Alberta had ruled it unconstitutional. Both were also appealed and the three cases were heard together before the Supreme Court. \r\n\r\nOn March 25, 2021, the Supreme Court rejected Saskatchewan and Ontario's appeals and upheld the GGPPA as constitutional in a 6-3 decision. The Court upheld the Act under the POGG power of the constitution, reasoning that climate change was of sufficient national concern to warrant federal jurisdiction, provinces had a constitutional inability to set national GHG emission reduction standards, and the Act's impact on provincial jurisdiction is qualified and limited. The Court wrote that \"Canada has adduced evidence that clearly shows that establishing minimum national standards of GHG price stringency to reduce GHG emissions is of sufficient concern to Canada as a whole that it warrants consideration in accordance with the national concern doctrine.\" Provinces were incapable of addressing the problem in the same way because they could not set a national minimum GHG price, and \"a failure to include one province in the scheme would jeopardize its success in the rest of Canada.\" Further, the Court found that the GGPPA had a limited effect on provincial jurisdiction because it was limited to a narrow regulatory mechanism of pricing, not regulation of all aspects of GHG emissions, and because it only acts as a backstop if provincial pricing is found insufficient.

      "type": "case",
      "count": 1,
      "summary": "A group of eight Torres Strait Islanders, Australian nationals, and six of their children submitted a petition against the Australian government to the United Nations Human Rights Committee. They are all indigenous inhabitants of Boigu, Poruma, Warraber and Masig, four small, low-lying islands in Australia’s Torres Strait region. The Islanders claimed that changes in weather patterns have direct harmful consequences on their livelihood, their culture and traditional way of life. The Islanders indicated that severe flooding caused by the tidal surge in recent years has destroyed family graves and left human remains scattered across their islands. They argued that maintaining ancestral graveyards and visiting and communicating with deceased relatives are at the heart of their cultures. In addition, the most important ceremonies, such as coming-of-age and initiation ceremonies, are only culturally meaningful if performed in the community's native lands. The Islanders also argued that changes in climate with heavy rainfall and storms have degraded the land and trees and have consequently reduced the amount of food available from traditional fishing and farming. On Masig Island, for example, the rising sea level has caused saltwater to seep into the soil and coconut trees to become diseased, subsequently killing off the fruit, and its coconut water, which are part of the Islanders’ traditional diet.\r\n\r\nThe Islanders claimed their rights had been violated as Australia failed to adapt to climate change by, inter alia, upgrading seawalls on the islands and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The petition alleges that Australia is violating the plaintiffs’ fundamental human rights under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) due to the government’s failure to address climate change. This petition represents the first climate change legal action in Australia that makes an argument based on a violation of human rights. It also constitutes the first legal action filed with a UN body by inhabitants of low-lying islands against a national government for inaction on climate change.\r\n\r\nThe plaintiffs inhabit a group of islands off the northern tip of Queensland, Australia, between the Australian mainland and Papua New Guinea. These low-lying island communities are highly vulnerable to climate change impacts including sea level rise, storm surge, coral bleaching, and ocean acidification. According to materials released by the plaintiffs, the complaint alleges that Australia’s insufficient action on climate change has violated the following rights under the ICCPR: Article 27 (the right to culture), Article 17 (the right to be free from arbitrary interference with privacy, family and home), and Article 6 (the right to life). The complaint further argues these violations stem from both insufficient targets and plans to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions and inadequate funding for coastal defense and resilience measures on the islands, such as seawalls. \r\n\r\nOn August 13, 2020, Australia asked the Committee to dismiss the petition.\r\n\r\nOn September 23, 2022, the U.N. Human Rights Committee found that Australia’s failure to adequately protect indigenous Torres Islanders against adverse impacts of climate change violated their rights to enjoy their culture and be free from arbitrary interferences with their private life, family and home. The Committee took into account the Islanders’ spiritual connection with their traditional lands, and the dependence of their cultural integrity on the health of their surrounding ecosystems. It therefore found that Australia’s failure to take timely and adequate measures to protect the indigenous Islanders against adverse climate change impacts led to the violation of their rights to enjoy their own culture and to be free from arbitrary interferences with their private life, family and home. The Committee indicated that despite Australia’s series of actions, such as the construction of new seawalls on the four islands that are expected to be completed by 2023, additional timely and appropriate measures were required to avert a risk to the Islanders’ lives, since without robust national and international efforts, the effects of climate change may expose individuals to a violation of their right to life under the Covenant. As remedies, the Committee asked Australia to compensate the indigenous Islanders for the harm suffered, engage in meaningful consultations with their communities to assess their needs, and take measures to continue to secure the communities’ safe existence on their respective islands.",

      "summary": "The French NGOs Notre Affaire à Tous, Sherpa, Zea, and Les Eco Maires along with more than a dozen French local governments have taken the first step in a legal proceeding against French oil company and carbon major Total. The initiative seeks a court order forcing Total to issue a corporate strategy that 1) identifies the risks resulting from GHG emissions resulting from the use of goods and services that Total produces, 2) identifies the risks of serious climate-related harms as outlined in the 2018 IPCC special report, and 3) undertakes action to ensure the company’s activities align with a trajectory compatible with the climate goals of the Paris Agreement. The plaintiffs argue these obligations stem from domestic law Article L. 225-102-4.-I of the Commercial Code (Loi 27 Mars 2017 sur le devoir de vigilance des sociétés mères et des entreprises donneuses d'ordre). This law requires a company to produce a \"plan of vigilance\" that identifies and seeks to mitigate risks to human rights, fundamental freedoms, the environment, and public health that could result directly or indirectly from the operations of the company and of the companies it controls.\r\n\r\nOn June 18th, 2019, following a formal meeting with Total, the plaintiffs announced the launch of a legal proceeding and issued a letter of formal notice (mise en demeure) to Total. Plaintiffs asserted that Total had 3 months to include adequate GHG emissions reductions targets in its latest “plan de vigilance” before they filed a lawsuit seeking a court order to force the company to comply with the law and the goals of the Paris Climate Agreement.\r\n\r\nOn January 28, 2020, plaintiffs filed a complaint asking a Nanterre court to order Total to recognize the risks generated by its business activities and make it conduct consistent with the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5°C. According to the plaintiffs, their complaint relies on the Law on the Duty of Vigilance, as well as the duty of environmental vigilance arising out of the the French Environmental Charter. The plaintiffs allege that Total didn't provide enough detailed information in its vigilance plan for reducing its emissions and the company is still not in line with international climate agreements.\r\n\r\nTotal did not respond to the merits and requested that the case be brought before the commercial court. On February 11, 2021, the pre-trial judge rejected Total's objection of incompetence and confirmed the jurisdiction of the judicial court. The judge considers that the NGOs have, as “non-traders”, a right of option, which they exercise at their convenience, between the judicial court, which they have validly seized, and the commercial court. On November 18, 2021, the Versailles Court of Appeal confirmed the jurisdiction of the Nanterre judicial court to settle the dispute. The decision is based on the exclusive jurisdiction of certain courts of law in matters of cessation and compensation for ecological damage.\r\n\r\nOn July 21, 2022, the City of New York intervened in support of the Plaintiffs in the current litigation through an intervention volontaire accessoire. The City of New York has based its intervention on the significant interest it has in engaging – locally and globally – in efforts to mitigate climate change, also because of the severe damages and risks this phenomenon causes to the City.\r\n\r\nOn July 6, 2023, the pre-trial judge dismissed the preventive lawsuit for procedural reasons after several years of successful litigation on the Civil court's jurisdiction. The Paris first instance court also refused to examine the impact of TotalEnergies' activities on climate change. \r\nThe judge deems the lack of strict identity between the demands in the formal notice demands and summons as an inadmissibility ground. In addition, the judge believes no plaintiff has standing concerning climate change since it is a worldwide issue. Although it is a classical issue in climate litigation, the pre-trial judge's position clearly contradicts the French Admin Supreme Court finding in climate cases against the State (see paras 4 - 7 on standing). \r\n\r\nPlaintiffs have appealed the decision; the first hearing took place before the Court of Appeal of Paris on March 5, 2024. \r\n\r\nOn June 18, 2024, The French Court of Appeal reversed the pre-trial decision to dismiss the case and affirmed it has to proceed to trial.\r\n\r\nFirst, the Court has not upheld the Tribunal's affirmation that the notice to sue has to put forward the same claims advanced in the summons and that any discrepancies between the two is a cause for inadmissibility. On the contrary, the Court of Appeal has affirmed that the letter sent by the plaintiffs is to be considered as a notice to sue. The Court clarifies that the letter does not have to include all the future claims included in the summons, but that the future claims must have the same object indicated in the notice to sue. Moreover, the notice does not forcefully need to concern the same plan of the summons or of the final demands: if the company has not remedied its non-performance, the claim can still proceed. Furthermore, the Court states that the plaintiffs do not have signed or sent the notice: as the aim of the notice is to comply with its obligations and to remedy its non-fulfillment, it is not necessary, to sue, to have sent also the notice. \r\n\r\nSecond, it states that claims based on environmental harms (articles 1246 of the French civil codes) are not inadmissible, because they do not replicate the claims based on the law on the duty of vigilance (the rule lex specialia generalibus derogant does not apply in this case). Indeed, these two laws have different aims, as the law on the duty of vigilance forces the company to draft a plan, and the environmental harm aims to redress damages and put an end to damaging behaviors.\r\n\r\nFinally, concerning standing, the court highlights that climate change is a global phenomenon that goes beyond the local interest of the municipality. Therefore, to have standing, a municipality needs to prove a specific interest to sue, that is a specific effect of climate change on the territory of the municipality concerned. ",

The defendant Ball participated in an interview with the FCPP and John Doe during which Ball made allegedly false and defamatory statements inferring that Michael Mann is guilty of criminal fraud in relation to the alleged “Climategate” scandal or alternatively that there are probably grounds to find Mann guilty. The plaintiff sought damages, an injunction against further publication of the defamatory statements, and a court order for the defendants to remove the interview containing the defamatory statements from all electronic databases, including the FCPP website. In June 2019, the FCPP settled with Mann and issued a retraction and apology on their website. \r\n\r\nOn August 22, 2019, the court dismissed the case on account of delay. The court found that two periods of delay totalling 35 months constituted \"inordinate delay\" that could not be excused on account of the plaintiff being occupied with other matters. The court further found that this delay had caused prejudice to the defendant because three of the defendants' planned witnesses had died.

      "summary": "A coalition of women filed a constitutional petition on their behalf and on behalf of future generations against the Federation of Pakistan. They allege that the federal government’s inaction on climate change violated their fundamental rights including the right to a clean and healthy environment and a climate capable of sustaining human life, (a right which was previously recognized in Asghar Leghari v. Federation of Pakistan 2018 CLD 424). They further argue that since climate change has a disproportionate impact on women, the government’s climate inaction violates plaintiffs’ rights to equal protection under the law and no discrimination on the basis of sex.  \r\n\r\nPlaintiffs explain that the government specifically has failed to prioritize clean energy projects, even though solar and wind energy has become cheaper than conventional energy, and has not approved any clean energy projects between December 2017 and the filing of the suit. Plaintiffs argue this failure to abate greenhouse gas emissions violates the “clear mandate of the RE Policy 2006, the firm commitments made by the State of Pakistan pursuant to the Paris Agreement and the urgent threat of climate change. Plaintiffs further argue these violations amount to violations of constitutional rights. They state that the superior courts of Pakistan have held that “Fundamental Rights like the right to life and security of person under Articles 4 and 9 [of the constitution] include the right to a healthy and clean environment,” and have also “read” “the right to human dignity under Article 14” “with the constitutional principles of democracy, equality, social, economic and political justice” “including within their ambit the international environmental principles of sustainable development, precautionary principle, environmental impact assessment, inter and intra‑generational equity and public trust doctrine.”\r\n\r\nEmissions reductions in the energy sector were critical, according to the petitioners, as the sector was responsible for 47% of Pakistan’s total emissions. In Pakistan’s 2016 NDC, the government committed to a 20% reduction of its 2030 projected GHG emissions. Despite this, petitioners maintained that respondents had neither prioritized clean energy projects nor approved a renewable energy project since December 2017. The petitioners alleged that this failure betrayed the government’s “stated commitment under the Paris Agreement to encourage and foster the development of renewable energy sources”. Khan et al. also argued that the respondents violated the public trust doctrine and principle of intergenerational equity, as well as the concept of climate justice developed in Leghari v. Federation of Pakistan. The petitioners sought orders declaring that the government must support renewable energy projects and enforce the Paris Agreement in letter and spirit. ",

The Lamu Plant would be the first coal-fired power plant in Kenya. The Tribunal found that the National Environmental Management Authority violated the Environmental Impact Assessment & Audit Regulations (“EIA Regulations”) by granting an Environmental Impact Assessment License without proper and meaningful public participation in the process.  \r\n\r\nAdditionally, the Tribunal found that the Amu Power Company’s Environmental & Social Impact Assessment was incomplete and scientifically insufficient in violation of the regulations. Applying the precautionary principle, the Tribunal found one of the insufficiencies of the assessment was the inadequate consideration of climate change and the Climate Change Act of 2016. The Tribunal ordered the Amu Power Company, if it should choose to pursue the project, to conduct a new EIA study in compliance with the EIA Regulations. The Tribunal further instructed the Amu Power Company that the new EIA study must include “all approved and legible detailed architectural and engineering plans for the plant and its ancillary facilities (such as the coal storage and handling facility and the ash pit with its location in relation to the sea shore), consideration of the Climate Change Act 2016, the Energy Act 2019 and the Natural Resources (Classes of Transactions subject to Ratification) Act 2016 in so far as the project will utilise sea water for the plant and/ or if applicable.”\r\n\r\nThe Amu Power Company appealed to the Land and Environment Court in June 2019.

The Administrative Court referred the case to the European Union’s Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling interpreting the laws which establish a greenhouse gas emission allowance trading system with the European Union to determine whether this facility was entitled to ghg allowances free of charge.\r\n\r\nOn June 20, 2019, the Court of Justice ruled that part of Exxon’s natural gas processing plant in Germany should be classified as an electricity generator. The Court of Justice interpreted Article 3(u) and Article 10a of, and Annex I to, Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council (which established a scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading within the EU) and as amended by Directive 2009/29/EC (“Directive 2003/87”). It additionally interpreted Article 3(c) and (h) of Commission Decision 2011/278/EU concerning rules for the temporary free allocation of emission allowances pursuant to Article 10a of Directive 2003/87. The court concluded that Article 3(u) of Directive 2003/87/EC must be interpreted to mean that an installation, such as that at issue in the proceedings, (which produces electricity through the “combustion of fuels in installations with a total rated thermal input exceeding 20 [megawatts (MW)]”), must be understood as an ‘electricity generator’ when even a small portion of that electricity is continuously fed into the public electricity network (unless the product of the installation meets an exempted category in the annex). The installation in question could not be exempted even if its purpose was to produce electricity for the natural gas processing facility. The Court of Justice further determined that Article 3(c) of Commission Decision 2011/278/EU must be interpreted to mean that an installation such as that at issue in the main proceedings is not entitled to be allocated free emission allowances for the heat produced “where that heat is used for purposes other than the production of electricity, since such an installation does not fulfill the conditions laid down in Article 10a(4) and (8) of the directive.” The activities of natural gas desulphurisation and sulphur recovery did not meet the criteria of those articles.\r\n\r\nAn analyst reviewing the decision noted that if it is followed by EU governments, it could result in thousands of facilities no longer qualifying for free allocation of ghg emission permits and drive up the cost of carbon in the market.",

      "summary": "On November 18, 2010, Costa Rica filed an action against Nicaragua in the International Court of Justice (ICJ), alleging an “incursion into, occupation of and use by Nicaragua’s army of Costa Rican territory as well as [alleged] breaches of Nicaragua’s obligations towards Costa Rica” under a number of international treaties and conventions.  As part of this proceeding, Costa Rica sought compensation for the loss of environmental goods and services the country sustained due to Nicaragua’s excavation of channels on its territory. Among the services for which Costa Rica sought compensation was the impaired ability of the excavated area to provide “gas regulation and air quality services, such as carbon sequestration.” On February 2, 2018, the ICJ ruled how much Nicaragua must compensate Costa Rica for the loss of environmental services. This followed a ruling on the merits from December 16, 2015 that established that Nicaragua’s activities were unlawful and violated Costa Rica's territorial sovereignty and navigational rights, as well as the Court's Order of 8 March 2011, and found that Costa Rica should be compensated for these unlawful activities.\r\n\r\nCosta Rica argued that Nicaragua had, on two separate incidents, occupied the territory of Costa Rica in connection with the construction of a canal across Costa Rican territory from the San Juan River to Laguna los Portillos (or “Harbor Head Lagoon”) and associated acts of dredging on the San Juan River. Nicaragua removed nearly 300 trees and cleared 6.19 hectares of vegetation in excavating the Costa Rican channels.  The Costa Rican government sought compensation for the impaired ability of the excavated area to provide environmental goods and services including “gas regulation and air quality services, such as carbon sequestration.”  In ruling for Costa Rica, the ICJ reasoned that Nicaragua’s activities significantly undermined the ability of the two areas to provide environmental goods and services.  Because this loss of environmental services was a direct result of Nicaragua’s actions, the ICJ ruled that Nicaragua must compensate Costa Rica US$120,000 for the impairment or loss of the environmental goods and services of the impacted area in the period prior to recovery. Furthermore, the ICJ did “not consider that the impairment or loss” of carbon sequestration services could be valued as a one- time loss. This was the first case wherein in ICJ adjudicated a claim for compensation for environmental damage.\r\n",

Petitioners requested a writ of mandamus under Article 199 of Pakistan’s Constitution and alleged the government’s conduct violated their fundamental rights guaranteed under Article 9 (right of life liberty), Article 14 (right of dignity), Article 26 (right of access to public places of entertainment) and Article 38(b) (provision of available leisure places) of the Constitution. Petitioners asked the court, inter alia, to appraise the government’s implementation of relevant policies to increase forest cover; to implement the Forest Act, 1927 (the “Forest Act”) and the Punjab Plantation and Maintenance of Trees Act, 1974 (the “Trees Act”) by planting trees; to present a timeline for implementation, and to initiate appropriate proceedings against officers who failed to discharge their duties.\r\n\r\nThe High Court of Lahore allowed the writ of mandamus, ordering the government to fulfill their obligations under the law “to safely manage, conserve, sustain, maintain, protect and grow forests and plant trees in urban cities.” The court summarized a variety of requirements under natural resource, development, local government, and international law to establish the government’s obligations to protect the forest including the “Forest Act” and “Trees Act.” It directed the government to take its legal obligations seriously in implementing related policies, including the National Climate Change Policy, 2012, the National Forest Policy, 2015, the Forest Policy Statement, 1999 and Punjab Environment Policy, 2015. It noted that if the government had properly fulfilled its legal obligations “in letter and spirit” “the forest of Pakistan could have been saved [from] further depletion and deforestation.” In its discussion of relevant law, the court touched on the right to a healthy environment, the precautionary principle, and the public trust doctrine. Specifically, in regard to climate change, the court summarized the negative impacts of climate change on forests and obligations under the National Climate Change Policy, 2012 to protect biodiversity and prevent wetland degradation by reducing deforestation.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the decision, the involved government bodies had already prepared an Urban Trees Plantation Policy under direction of the court resulting in “massive” plantings across the Punjab area.

The children ask the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child (“the Committee”) to declare that respondents violated their rights by perpetuating climate change, and to recommend actions for respondents to address climate change mitigation and adaptation.  \r\n\r\nPetitioners claim that climate change has led to violations of their rights under the Convention, including the rights to life, health, and the prioritization of the child’s best interest, as well as the cultural rights of petitioners from indigenous communities.  For example, Deborah Adegbile of Nigeria asserts that she has been repeatedly hospitalized for asthma attacks triggered by rising temperatures and exacerbated smog.  Ellen-Anne of Sweden alleges that climate change imperils her indigenous community’s traditional reliance on reindeer husbandry and herding.  David Ackley III, Litokne Kabua, and Ranton Anjain of the Marshall Islands similarly claim that sea-level rise poses an existential threat to their culture.  \r\n\r\nEach respondent has ratified the Convention.  All five have signed the Paris Agreement but, according to petitioners, none have made or kept commitments that align with keeping temperature rise under 2 degrees Celsius.  The petition asserts that respondents have four related obligations under the Convention: (i) to prevent foreseeable domestic and extraterritorial human rights violations resulting from climate change; (ii) to cooperate internationally in the face of the global climate emergency; (iii) to apply the precautionary principle to prevent deadly consequences even in the face of uncertainty; and (iv) to ensure intergenerational justice for children and posterity.  Petitioners allege that respondents have failed to prevent foreseeable human rights harms caused by climate change by making insufficient reductions to greenhouse gas emissions.  Petitioners further claim that as members of the G20, respondents have failed to use available legal, diplomatic, and economic tools to protect children from the greenhouse gas pollution of major emitters including China, the United Stations, the European Union and India.\r\n\r\nThe children request that the Committee make findings including that climate change is a children’s rights crisis, and that each respondent has caused and is perpetuating climate change by knowingly acting in disregard of available scientific evidence.  They also ask the Committee to recommend that the respondents review, and where necessary, amend their laws and policies to ensure that mitigation and adaptation efforts are accelerated; initiate cooperative international action to establish binding and enforceable climate measures; and ensure children’s right to be heard in all efforts to mitigate or adapt to the climate crisis.  The Committee must determine if the petition is actionable before making findings or recommendations.   \r\n\r\nBrazil, France and Germany responded to the petition, arguing that it was not admissible on three grounds: 1) the Committee lacks jurisdiction; 2) the petition is manifestly ill-founded or unsubstantiated; and 3) petitioners have not exhausted domestic remedies. On May 4, 2020, the petitioners filed a reply asserting that the petition is admissible. They argue: 1) that the Committee has jurisdiction because the children are \"directly and foreseeably injured by greenhouse gas emissions originating in Respondents' territory;\" 2) the claims are manifestly well-founded because the children are suffering direct and personal harms now and will continue to in the foreseeable future; and 3) that pursuing domestic remedies would be futile. \r\n\r\nOn October 12, 2021, the CRC rejected the claim as inadmissible. The Committee accepted the claimant's arguments that States are legally responsible for the harmful effects of emissions originating in their territory on children outside their borders. The fact that all states are causing climate change does not absolve states of individual responsibility to reduce their own share of emissions. The Committee also found that the youth are victims of foreseeable threats to their rights to life, health, and culture. \r\n\r\nFollowing the reasoning of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights (IACtHR)’  <a href=\"https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/request-advisory-opinion-inter-american-court-human-rights-concerning-interpretation-article-11-41-51-american-convention-human-rights/\">2017 advisory opinion</a>, the CRC found that countries have extraterritorial responsibilities related to carbon pollution. Using the IACtHR's test for jurisdiction, the Committee found that when transboundary harm occurs, children are under the jurisdiction of the State on whose territory the emissions originated if there is a causal link between the acts or omissions of the State in question and the negative impact on the rights of children located outside its territory, when the State of origin exercises effective control over the sources of the emissions in question. \r\n\r\nWhile the Committee said that the children had shown, for jurisdictional purposes, that the impairment of their rights as a result of the State party’s acts or omissions regarding the carbon emissions originating within its territory was reasonably foreseeable, it held that the complaint was inadmissible for a failure to exhaust local remedies. \r\n",

In the civil action, ClientEarth is requesting that the Regional Court for the city of Łódź order PGE GiEK S.A. to cease the use of lignite as a fuel for the production of energy at the Bełchatów Power Plant. According to ClientEarth’s petition, of the 12 units currently in operation at the Bełchatów Power Plant, 11 should be closed by 2030, with one being closed no later than by 2035.\r\n\r\nClientEarth’s claim is based on art. 323 cl. 1 and 2 of the Polish Environmental Protection Act, which grants standing to environmental NGOs to file civil lawsuits against entities whose illegal actions either damage or threaten to damage the environment as a public good. \r\nClientEarth alleges, inter alia, that in view of the fact that the Bełchatów Power Plant is the single largest emitter of carbon dioxide in the European Union and has materially contributed to climate change, the alleged damage caused to the environment by this power station is of a scale which transcends any private interest and negatively impacts the general environment. ClientEarth also contends that this power plant has had a negative impact on other aspects of the environment, including the water and soil in the surrounding region. This environmental damage is directly linked to the use by the power station of lignite as a fuel and, therefore, in order to redress damage that has already occurred and prevent damage which will occur in the future if nothing changes, the use of lignite at this power station must cease as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nWhile art. 323 of the Polish Environmental Protection Act has on occasion provided the legal basis for rare interventions, ClientEarth’s intervention (as far as ClientEarth is aware) is the first in Poland launched by an NGO for the protection of the environment as a public good in the context of climate change, and the first to use art. 323 as a basis for a court in Poland to order a change in a company’s behavior. Owing to this, the case presents numerous novel legal issues, not least of which include: \r\na)\tthe definition of “illegal activity” as understood in art. 323 of the Polish Environmental Protection Act, particularly in the context of art. 325 of said act, which does not preclude permitted activity (i.e., conducted on the basis and within the parameters of an administrative permit) from being considered “illegal” under art. 323;\r\nb)\tthe bounds of permissible demands under art. 323 of the Polish Environmental Protection Act, and – related thereto – the issues of separation of powers under the Polish constitution, freedom of economic activity, and proportionality (i.e., whether a court can order the operator of a power plant to change the manner of operating the power plant, or whether this can only be done through a legislative process).\r\n\r\nOn September 22, 2020, the judge in the case ruled that PGE must negotiate with ClientEarth to attempt to reach a settlement within three months to swiftly reduce Belchatow’s climate impacts. According to ClientEarth, this marks the first time a Polish Court has required a coal plant to engage in such negotiations to reduce climate emissions. Negotiations between the parties, conducted as part of the court proceedings, did not bring any resolution. The case is pending, with the parties exchanging legal briefs and awaiting further developments.\r\n",

In November 2011 a German district court opened insolvency proceedings against the company, and Sandra Bitter was appointed insolvency administrator.  The German authorities requested that Bitter report and surrender emissions allowances for 2011 as required by the EU ETS, and Bitter responded that the company was not obligated to do so because it had ceased its business activity before the insolvency procedure began.

The European Court of Justice answered a number of referred questions related to the proper calculation of free allowances for the hotel metal industry.  \r\n\r\nDuring the third trading period of the EU ETS, from 2013-2020, sectors other than the electricity generation sector receive a limited number of emissions allowances for free (allowances in the electricity generation sector are all auctioned off).  In November 2013, the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency determined the final amount of free emission allowances to be allocated for the third trading period of the EU ETS.  Eight operators of greenhouse gas emitting facilities brought an action to invalidate the decision, and a Swedish court referred a number of legal questions to the European Court of Justice.  The claimants first took issue with the correction factor that the EU had adopted according to Article 15(3) of Decision 2011/278 and set forth in Article 4 and Annex II of Decision 2013/448.  The correction factor is applied to set the number of free allowances allocated to non-electricity generators in the event that the bottom-up calculation of allowances exceeds the applicable cap.  The Court noted that it had recently invalidated the correction factor, and the EU was in the midst of revising it.\r\n\r\nThe claimants also argued that the benchmark for the hot metal industry was improper for a number of reasons.  Product benchmarks are reference values that determine how many free allowances each installation in a particular industry will receive.  Under Directive 2003/87, a product benchmark must be established based on the performance of the 10% most efficient installations in the sector.  In implementing this rule, the European Commission overestimated the performances of installations producing hot metal.  The Court held that the resulting benchmark did not exceed the Commission's discretion, explaining that the Commission had verified that its starting point sufficiently reflected the most efficient techniques available, and used appropriate reference documents where data could not be verified or did not comply with the benchmarking methodology. \r\n\r\nThe claimants further challenged the treatment of waste gases produced by the hot metal sector. Under Decision 2011/278, the product benchmarks must take account of the efficient energy recovery of waste gases and emissions related to their use.  Under Article 15(3) of that Decision, where waste gases are exported from the production process outside the system boundaries of the relevant product benchmark and used to produce heat, related emissions should be taken into account for purposes of allocating allowances.  However, when such waste gases are used to produce electricity, additional allowances should not be allocated, in accordance with the principle that no free allowances should be allocated for electricity generation.  The Court upheld Article 15(3) as valid insofar as it excludes the taking into account of emissions from electricity generators for the purposes of determining the maximum annual amount of allowances.\r\n\r\nThe Court further determined that Decision 2011/278 permits a Member State to decline to allocate allowances to an operator for the consumption, in a heat benchmark sub-installation, of heat produced in a fuel benchmark sub-installation, based on the principle that emissions cannot be double-counted.  Similarly, the Court concluded, a Member State may decline to count emissions related to that exported heat when collecting data under the EU ETS, and may refuse to allocate free allowances for emissions related to the production of measurable heat by burning waste gases generated by a hot metal benchmark installation.  However, the Court held that the rule against double counting does not prohibit the allocation of free allowances on the basis of the heat benchmark for the combustion of waste gases, created during hot metal production, to supply heat to a district heating network. The Court reasoned that the Environmental Protection Agency had applied the heat benchmark in determining the amount of free allowances to be allocated, and considered emissions beyond the value set by the fuel benchmark to be taken into account under the hot metal benchmark. \r\n\r\nThe Court remanded the case to the Swedish court for a final ruling consistent with its opinion.

      "summary": "A German company operating a facility covered by the EU carbon emissions trading system argued that carbon dioxide that is transferred to a non-covered facility and becomes chemically bound - and is thus not released into the atmosphere - should not be considered \"emitted.\" The European Court of Justice agreed, invalidating an EU regulation insofar as it systematically included carbon dioxide that becomes so chemically bound in the trading scheme regardless of whether that carbon dioxide is actually emitted into the atmosphere. \r\n\r\nSchaefer Kalk GmbH & Co. KG (Schaefer Kalk) operates an installation for the calcination of lime in Hahnstätten, Germany, which is subject to the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS). During the lime calcination process carbon dioxide is emitted, which Schaefer Kalk transfers to an installation that is not covered by the EU ETS for the production of precipitated calcium carbonate (PCC).  In the process of getting its monitoring plan approved, Schaefer Kalk applied for authorization to subtract the carbon dioxide transferred for PCC production from the amount of greenhouse gas emissions in the company’s emissions report. Schaefer Kalk argued that the transferred carbon dioxide is chemically bound in the PCC and that, not being emitted into the atmosphere, it cannot be regarded as “emissions” as defined in Article 3(b) of Directive 2003/87/EC.\r\n\r\nThe German Emissions Trading Authority at the Federal Environment Agency (DEHSt) approved the monitoring plan without addressing the issue of subtracting transferred carbon dioxide. Schaefer Kalk brought a complaint to the DEHSt, which was rejected. The DEHSt argued that subtraction was not legal under Article 49 of Regulation (EU) No 601/2012 and Annex IV thereto, which only provides that carbon dioxide transferred to one of the long-term geological storage installations listed in that article may be subtracted from the emissions.\r\n\r\nSchaefer Kalk subsequently brought the matter before the Berlin Administrative Court and argued that Article 49(1) of Regulation No 601/2012 and point 10(B) of Annex IV thereto subject carbon dioxide bound in PCC and transferred for the production of that substance to mandatory participation in the EU ETS, and are therefore not covered by the powers granted under Article 14(1) of Directive 2003/87/EC. The Berlin Administrative Court then referred the matter to the European Court of Justice (ECJ).\r\n\r\nThe ECJ held that the second sentence of Article 49(1) of Regulation No 601/2012 and point 10(B) of Annex IV to that regulation are invalid in so far as they systematically include the carbon dioxide transferred to another installation for the production of PCC in the emissions of the lime combustion installation, regardless of whether or not that carbon dioxide is released into the atmosphere.",

      "count": 1,
      "summary": "The European Court of Justice (EJC) held that a coal-fired power plant and unburned coal in a storage site constitute one installation covered by the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS).  The EJC further concluded that the coal lost due to self-heating while in storage could not be regarded as exported fuel for purposes of monitoring emissions. \r\n\r\nElektriciteits Produktiemaatschappij Zuid-Nederland EPZ NV (EPZ) operates a coal-fired power plant in the Netherlands and holds a quantity of its unburned coal in a storage site approximately 800 meters from the power plant, which is separated from it by a public road. When designing the monitoring plan for the installation operated by EPZ for the third period of the EU ETS, the Dutch Emissions Authority (Nea) determined that coal lost due to its self-heating during the storage period could not be regarded as fuel exported from EPZ’s installation within the meaning of Article 27(2) of Regulation No 601/2012.\r\n\r\nConsequently, the NEa refused to approve modifications of the monitoring plan sought by EPZ and later rejected EPZ’s objection to their initial decision. EPZ then lodged an appeal with the Dutch Raad van State (Council of State), seeking to have the latter decision annulled. The Council of State referred the case to the EJC and asked for a preliminary ruling on two questions.\r\n\r\n(1) Could EPZ’s storage facility be considered an “installation” as referred to in Article 3(e) of Directive 2003/87/EC, which established the EU ETS? \r\n\r\n(2) Could EPZ’s lost coal due to its self-heating during storage be considered “fuel exported from the installation” as referred to in Article 27(2) of Regulation (EU) No 601/2012?  That provision allows operators to deduct the quantity of fuel exported from the installation for purposes of monitoring greenhouse gas emissions. \r\n\r\nOn the first question, the ECJ ruled that a fuel storage site of a coal-fired power plant is part of an “installation” within the meaning of Article 3(e) of Directive 2003/87/EC. The ECJ reasoned that the coal’s self-heating during storage does not amount to combustion and that it was not apparent that the coal’s self-heating required 20 MW of thermal input - two of the requirements for the storage site to be considered an installation under Annex I of Directive 2003/87/EC. However, the ECJ ruled that the coal is essential to the functioning of the power plant and is therefore directly associated with the plant’s activity. Moreover, because the coal’s self-heating emits greenhouse gases, storing coal is an activity that could have an effect on emissions and pollution within the meaning of Article 3(e) of Directive 2003/87/EC. The ECJ deemed it irrelevant that the storage site is located approximately 800 meters and across a public road from the power plant.\r\n\r\nOn the second question, the ECJ ruled that coal lost due to self-heating while in storage on a site that is part of an installation cannot be regarded as coal exported from that installation. Because the storage site is part of an installation within the meaning of Article 3(e) of Directive 2003/87/EC, it cannot be regarded as a separate installation. Therefore, coal lost due to self-heating cannot be considered to be exported from the installation in question.",

      "summary": "Claimant challenged Luxembourg's law implementing the EU Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS), which permitted the government to request the surrender of emissions allowances, without compensation, that had not been used because the claimant had ceased greenhouse gas-emitting activities.  The European Court of Justice (ECJ) held that the Luxembourg law was not inconsistent with Directive 2003/87/EC, which established the EU ETS. \r\n\r\nArcelorMittal Rodange et Schifflange SA (ArcelorMittal) operated an installation in Schifflange, Luxembourg until the end of 2011, which was subject to the EU ETS. Luxembourg’s Minister of the Environment allocated ArcelorMittal a total quantity of 405,365 emissions allowances for the period between 2008 to 2012. In April 2012, ArcelorMittal requested that the Minister of the Environment cease environmental monitoring because the activities of its Schifflange installation had been suspended for an indefinite period since the end of 2011. In June 2013, the Minister of Sustainable Development and Infrastructure (1) reduced the total emissions allowances allocated to ArcelorMittal between 2008 to 2012 and (2) requested that ArcelorMittal surrender 80,922 emissions allowances without compensation pursuant to Article 13(6) of a Luxembourgish law transposing Directive 2003/87/EC, the Law of 23 December 2004 establishing a scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading.  ArceclorMittal brought an action in an administrative court, which referred the matter to the Constitutional Court of Luxembourg, which in turn referred it to the EJC for a preliminary ruling. \r\n\r\nThe question before the EJC was whether Article 13(6) of the 2004 law, which allows the Luxembourgish Minister of the Environment to order the surrender, without full or partial compensation, of allowances issued but not used, is compatible with Directive 2003/87/EC, or whether Directive 2003/87/EC must be interpreted as precluding national laws that allow the competent authorities to require the surrender without compensation of emissions allowances that have been issued but not used.\r\n\r\nThe ECJ held that Directive 2003/87 must be interpreted as not precluding national legislation that allows member states to require the surrender, without full or partial compensation, of unused allowances that have been improperly issued to an operator, as a result of the operator's failure to comply with its obligation to timely inform the competent authority of the cessation of the operation of an installation. The EJC further concluded that the allowances issued after an operator has ceased the activities performed in the installation to which those allowances relate, without informing the competent authority beforehand, cannot be classified as emissions “allowances” within the meaning of Directive 2003/87.",

      "summary": "Fifteen children and youths brought suit against the Queen and Attorney General of Canada in October 2019, alleging that Canada emits and contributes to emitting greenhouse gases that are incompatible with a stable climate. The plaintiffs argue that Canada's actions have violated their rights under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedom, as well as the rights of present and future Canadian children under the public trust doctrine. They seek declaratory relief and an order requiring the government to adopt a Climate Recovery Plan. \r\n\r\nIn dismissing the case, the judge ruled that the plaintiffs' claims that Canada's conduct violated their rights under the Charter of Rights and Freedoms are not justiciable and state no reasonable cause of action. According to the judge, the claims are not justiciable because they allege \"an overly broad and unquantifiable number of actions and inactions on the part of the Defendants.\" Similarly, these claims do not state a reasonable cause of action because they point to broad and diffused conduct by the government and do not identify a particular law that burdens youth. \r\n\r\nThe judge found that the plaintiffs' claims that the government's conduct violated the public trust doctrine was justiciable, but similarly found that it stated no reasonable cause of action because the claim was extensive, had no definable limits, and was not consistent with incremental evolutions in the law. \r\n\r\nPlaintiffs are children and youth in Canada who allege that they have been and will continue to be exposed to climate change impacts that interfere with their physical and psychological well being, as well as their ability to make fundamental life choices. The plaintiffs assert that because of their vulnerability and age, they will bear a disproportionate share of the burden imposed by climate change. They claim that Canada has caused, contributed to, and allowed a level of greenhouse gas emissions that is incompatible with a stable climate system; adopted greenhouse gas emissions targets that are inconsistent with the best available science regarding what action is necessary to avoid dangerous climate change; failed to meet its own national greenhouse gas emission targets; and actively participated in and supported the development, expansion, and operation of industries and activities involving fossil fuels that emit a level of greenhouse gases that is incompatible with a stable climate.  \r\n\r\nPlaintiffs seek declarations that defendants have unjustifiably infringed their rights -- and the rights of all present and future children and youth in Canada -- under the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Specifically, plaintiffs allege that defendants have violated Section 7 of the Charter, which protects the rights to life, liberty and security; and Section 15 of the Charter, which provides that every individual is equal under the law. Plaintiffs also argue that Canada has a common law and constitutional obligation to protect the integrity of common natural resources that are fundamental to sustaining human life and liberties, and seek a declaration that defendants have failed to discharge their public trust obligations with respect to those resources. Finally, they seek an order requiring defendants to develop and implement an enforceable Climate Recovery Plan that is consistent with Canada's fair share of the global carbon budget necessary to achieve greenhouse gas emissions, and ask the court to retain jurisdiction to ensure the plan is implemented.  \r\n\r\nOn February 7, 2020 the government filed a statement of defense acknowledging that climate change is real and has a significant effect on Canada, but arguing that the plaintiffs lack public interest standing and that their claims are not justiciable. Plaintiffs responded on August 31. On October 27, in spite of acknowledging that “the negative impact of climate change to the Plaintiffs and all Canadians is significant, both now and looking forward into the future,” Justice Michael D. Manson of the Federal Court of Canada granted the government’s motion to strike the plaintiffs’ claim. Attorneys for the youth plaintiffs intend to appeal.

      "summary": "Six nongovernmental organizations have sued energy company Total over an oil project in Uganda and Tanzania. The plaintiffs allege that Total failed to adequately assess the project's threats to human rights and the environment. \r\n\r\nUnder 2017 French Duty of Vigilance Law, French companies must identify and prevent, in a due diligence plan (plan de vigilance), serious violations of human rights and to the environment that could occur as a result of their business practices, including at the level of their foreign subsidiaries and subcontractors. In June 2019, Friends of the Earth France, Survie, AFIEGO, CRED, NAPE/Friends of the Earth Uganda and NAVODA sent Total a formal demand to revise its vigilance plan for the Tilenga Project, along with a report detailing alleged inadequacies in the vigilance plan. These associations claimed that Total did not take into account the social and environmental impacts of the oil project located on the shores of Lake Albert, in western Uganda, and the 1,445 km pipeline that will export fossil fuel by crossing part of the country and then Tanzania to reach the port of Tanga, on the Indian Ocean. Some 100,000 people are to be displaced and a third of the 400 boreholes are to be drilled in the Murchinson Falls National Park, which is home to a significant number of endangered species. The claimants sought an order to take urgent action to prevent the manifestly unlawful disturbance resulting the company’s failure to comply with its due diligence obligations. In the alternative, the claimants sought an order, subject to fine, to establish, publish and implement a set of measures in its due diligence plan to prevent (i) serious violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms, human health and safety and (ii) serious environmental damage. Although the claimants' report focuses on human rights and conventional pollution, it also argues that Total's vigilance plan does not properly account for the project's potential life cycle greenhouse gas emissions. \r\n\r\nTotal rejected the allegations and argued that the court in which the case was filed was not competent. On January 30, 2020, the Nanterre Judicial Court ruled that it was not competent to hear the case and that it must be brought before a commercial court. On December 10th, 2020, the Court of Appeal of Versailles decided that the case should be brought before the Nanterre Commercial Court because the due diligence plan should be qualified as an “act of management of a commercial company.” \r\n\r\nOn December 15th, 2021, the Court of Cassation overturned the judgment of the Versailles Court of Appeal and recognized the competence of the judicial court to judge the complaint of the associations. The case will be decided by the Nanterre Judicial Court, and not by the Commercial Court as Total had claimed. The Court of Cassation recalled that (i) companies’ duty of vigilance does not constitute a commercial act and (ii) a natural person plaintiff can bring a claim against a legal entity before the judicial court or the commercial court. While this decision is favorable for the claimant, more than 100 000 people are still totally or partially deprived of their land and their means of subsistence in Uganda and Tanzania, according to Friends of the Earth France. \r\n\r\nHowever, Act No. 2021-1729 of December 22, 2021, which came into force on the following December 24, gave exclusive jurisdiction concerning the actions founded on the Law on the duty of vigilance to the Judicial Tribunal of Paris.\r\nTherefore, on April 21, 2022, the Nanterre high court declared itself incompetent in favor of the summary proceedings court of the Judicial Court of Paris, before the interim procedure has continued.\r\n\r\nOn February 28, 2023, the court has published its two decisions. The court has recalled that the summary procedure is a judicial mechanism that enables a rapid examination of a dispute. The interim relief judge is responsible for providing an urgent response to a controversy by pronouncing interim measures, in order to preserve the rights of the parties before their assessment by the judge of the merits of the dispute.\r\n\r\nThe court has stated that it is within the powers of the summary proceedings judge to issue an injunction in application of the above-mentioned provisions when the company, subject to the duty of vigilance, has not drafted a plan, or when the summary and incomplete nature of the plan is tantamount to the non-existence of the plan, or when a manifest unlawfulness can be found. However, it is not within the powers of the judge in summary proceedings to assess the reasonableness of the measures provided for by the plan, when this assessment requires an in-depth examination of the elements of the case, which is the sole responsibility of the judge on the merits. These conditions, set forth by articles 834 and 835 of the Code of Civil Procedure, were not present in these cases, because the court considered that the case was too complex to be dealt with under an emergency procedure.\r\n\r\nThis judgment is devoid of any res judicata in the main proceedings, the judge on the merits can give a different judgment.\r\n",

In response, Ecojustice assisted seven youth environmental activists who filed an application against Ontario, contesting the constitutionality of CTCA. The Applicants argued that the revised target did not adequately address the risks associated with climate change, thereby violating the rights of Ontario youth and future generations as protected by sections 7 and 15 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. They contended that their section 7 right to life, liberty, and security of the person was infringed due to the perilous and existential threats posed by climate change to the lives and well-being of Ontarians. The Applicants maintained that their section 15 right to equality was violated because the revised target created a distinction based on age, imposing a greater burden on younger Ontarians who would endure the long-term impacts of climate change. They sought a declaration that the revised target was unconstitutional and an order requiring Ontario to establish a revised emissions target grounded in scientific principles, consistent with Ontario’s commitments under the Paris Agreement.\r\n\r\nOn April 15, 2020, Ontario filed a motion seeking to dismiss the case on the grounds that the claim was not justiciable. Ontario argued that determining emissions reductions was inherently political and thus unsuitable for judicial review.

On April 14, 2023, Justice Vermette of the Ontario Superior Court determined that while the Applicants’ claim was justiciable, there was no violation of the Applicants’ sections 7 and 15 Charter rights. Regarding section 7 of the Charter, Justice Vermette found that the province’s revised target for reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions was not arbitrary, as it was linked to the objective of GHG reduction under the CTCA. With respect to section 15 of the Charter, Justice Vermette concluded that the provision did not impose a positive obligation on the provincial government to take any specific actions to combat climate change. The Ontario Superior Court, therefore, dismissed the case. \r\n\r\nThe applicants appealed to the Court of Appeal for Ontario in May 2023. On October 17, 2024, the Court of Appeal for Ontario released its decision unanimously in favor of the appeal. The Court found that the applicants’ case was not a positive rights case but rather a negative rights case because they were not requesting that Ontario implement specific climate change actions. Instead, they contended that the greenhouse gas emissions targets set by the Minister under the CTCA violated their Charter rights. In other words, by enacting the CTCA, the Ontario government voluntarily assumed a positive statutory obligation to combat climate change in a way that complies with the Charter. Given the lack of a complete evidentiary record, the ONCA declined to determine the applicants’ case on its merits and remitted the application for further consideration by the lower court.\r\n\r\nOn December 16, 2024, the Ontario government filed an application for leave to appeal the case to the Supreme Court of Canada. On May 1, 2025, the Supreme Court rejected the appeal. The case will now return to the Ontario Superior Court of Justice for a new trial. ",

The complaint alleges that the campaign runs afoul of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises, which require clear, honest, accurate and informative communications between enterprises and the public. The complaint asserts that the advertising gives a false impression of the relative scale of renewable and low-carbon energy in BP's business; misleadingly omits full lifecycle emissions for natural gas and claims an inaccurate emissions saving against coal combustion; and misleadingly asserts that increases in global primary energy demand are both desirable and inevitable for human progress and development. \r\n\r\nClientEarth filed the complaint against BP with the UK National Contact Point for the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises (UK NCP), an administrative body. The complaint asks BP to take certain steps to correct the allegedly misleading information, including by withdrawing specific advertisements and issuing a statement explaining the withdrawal. The complaint further asks that the UK NCP find BP in violation of the OECD Guidelines if BP does not take the requested steps. \r\n\r\nAs a result of the complaint, BP has withdrawn the advertising campaign and pledged that it will discontinue “corporate reputation\r\nadvertising” and redirect “resources to promote net zero policies, ideas, actions, collaborations and its own net zero ambition.” Although the NCP's Initial Assessment confirmed that the complaint was material and substantiated, the case was subsequently discontinued after BP withdrew the advertising campaign in question.\r\n",

      "count": 1,
      "summary": "An appellate regulatory body dismissed a claim that in seeking to recover over-allocated allowances under the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS), a UK regulator needed to \"net off\" other allowances to which the operator was entitled. \r\n\r\nAppellant Repsol holds a greenhouse gas emissions permit under the EU ETS for an offshore oil-production, storage and offloading unit called Bleo Holm. Pursuant to the EU ETS, Repsol received a free allocation of allowances for the period 2012-2017 based on a historic baseline assessment of CO2 emissions from Bleo Holm, and was required to surrender sufficient allowances to cover its total emissions each year, whether the free allowances or additional allowances that had been purchased.  Following an investigation, the Offshore Production Regulator for Environment and Decommissioning (OPRED) found that there had been a significant decrease in capacity at Bleo Holm and, as a result, determined that Repsol was not entitled to all of the free allowances that it had received.  OPRED sought to recover the over-allocated allowances under the Greenhouse Gas Emissions Trading Scheme Regulations 2012 on behalf of the Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS).  OPRED is still investigating another significant capacity reduction issue which may have resulted in an over-allocation of allowances to Repsol. \r\n\r\nWhile the issues related to Repsol's allowances for 2013-2017 were under review, in December 2018, the European Commission decided to suspend the allocation of free allowances to UK operators in light of the uncertainties surrounding the UK's exit from the European Union.  As a result, Repsol did not receive free allowances in 2018 as expected, and so the company had to purchase sufficient allowances to offset its emissions for that year. \r\n\r\nIn March 2019 Repsol appealed BEIS's Notice of Recovery, bringing three claims before the Tribunal General Regulatory Chamber. First, Repsol contended that BEIS should not have sought to recover the total number of allowances that had been over-allocated for 2012-2017, but rather, should have netted off the allowances that Repsol did not receive in 2018 due to the European Commission's decision to suspend the allocation of free allowances to UK operators.  Second, Repsol argued that the European Commission's decision to withhold allowances from UK operators was unlawful.  Third, Repsol claimed that by seeking recovery of allowances without netting off the allowances to which Repsol was entitled, BEIS violated Repsol's property rights under Article 1 of the First Protocol to the European Convention on Human Rights.  Repsol asked the Tribunal to quash the Notice of Recovery.\r\n\r\nOn November 18, 2019, the Tribunal dismissed the appeal. According to the Tribunal's order, the parties agree there was an over-allocation of allowances as a result of Repsol's failure to notify BEIS of the decreased capacity at Bleo Holm, and so BEIS had the power to issue a Notice of Recovery. The Tribunal further explained that although a Notice of Recovery must provide certain information to an operator, this does not include the details of any calculation to determine the sum of allowances to which the operator is entitled.  Therefore, the Tribunal reasoned, the sum of allowances does not include any netting-off calculation. Moreover, the 2012 regulations are intended to implement a strict accounting system.  Given this, the Tribunal determined that BEIS did not err in declining to net off any allowances from the Notice of Recovery.  The Tribunal further concluded that it lacked jurisdiction to re-interpret the European Commission's decision to suspend allowance allocations to UK operators or to declare the decision unlawful.  Finally, the Tribunal held that it lacked the power to resolve Repsol's property rights claim. ",

The complainants assert that the UK-based company Ascent Resources plc (\"Ascent Resources\") violated the OECD Guidelines in applying for a permit to expand a fracking operation at a natural gas field near Petišovci, Slovenia.  The complaint also implicates Ascent Resources's subsidiary in Slovenia, Ascent Resources d.o.o., and its contractor, Geonergo, d.o.o. \r\n\r\nThe complaint asserts that Ascent Resources ran afoul of the OECD Guidelines by: failing to take adequate steps to consider and address the potential environmental impacts of fracking, including fracking's contribution to the threat of runaway climate change; failing to work with a view to achieving sustainable development and take due account of the need to protect the environment; engaging in improper political involvement by organizing a lobby campaign to pressure the Slovenian Ministry of the Environment to complete the permitting process for the fracking expansion without complication; failing to undertake required due diligence by not ensuring that its subsidiary and contractor considered all the environmental and health risks of fracking; incentivizing its subsidiary and contractor to cause adverse environmental and health impacts through fracking; and improperly avoided engagement with relevant stakeholders including local anti-fracking groups. The complaint also faults Geonergo, Ascent Resources's contractor, for seeking an exemption from the need to undertake an environmental impact assessment.  The complainants argue that the NCP should view Ascent Resources's activities in the context of international climate treaties given that fracking contributes to global climate change. \r\n\r\nThe complainants request that the Slovenian NCP bring their concerns to Ascent Resources and facilitate a dialogue aimed at ending the company's fracking activities in Slovenia. They also call on the UK NCP to support the Slovenian NCP in handling the complaint. Should a mediated solution prove unattainable, the complainants ask that the NCP inform the Slovenian authorities of the alleged breaches of the OECD Guidelines and urge that the allegations be considered in the permitting process. \r\n\r\n",

      "count": 1,
      "summary": "On May 27, 2019, 45 Japanese citizens filed suit to block the construction of a new coal-fired power plant. The plaintiffs filed a legal challenge against the Japanese Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry, seeking cancelation of the notice of finalization of the environmental impact assessment for the construction of two new coal-fired generating units - totaling 1,300 MW - at the Yokosuka power plant. The plaintiffs allege that JERA, the plant operator, improperly exploited a streamlined assessment process for replacements or upgrades that the Japanese Government created after the Fukushima Fukushima Daiichi nuclear accident.\r\n\r\nOn January 27, 2023, the Tokyo District Court delivered a judgment that dealt with the request to cancel the Notice of Confirmation issued by the Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry, who confirmed the Environmental Impact Assessment of JERA under Article 46 (17) (ii) of the Electricity Business Act. Firstly, the judgment discussed if the Notice of Confirmation was considered disposition against which an administrative complaint could be made. On this point, the Court determined that the Notice of Confirmation was considered disposition within the meaning of Article 3 (2) of the Administrative Case Litigation Act since the recipient of the Notice was an essential requirement for starting the operation of a power plant and granted legal status to JERA. Secondly, the judgment discussed if the Plaintiffs had standing and to what extent claims could be made. The Court stated that those persons who lived close to the coal-fired power plant and were likely to directly suffer significant damage from air pollution had legal interests to request the cancelation of the Notice of Confirmation. On the other hand, the Court stated that the damage from climate change could not be considered an individual interest to be protected by law. Thus, the Court recognized the standing of the Plaintiffs who lived within 20 km of the coal-fired power plant related to air pollution but did not recognize the standing and claims related to climate change and CO2 emissions. Lastly, the judgment discussed if the Notice of Confirmation was legal. The Court stated that the consideration of the alternative fuels was not obligatory and the use of the simplified procedure of the assessment was rational when the nature of the power plant (in this case, replacement) fell under the scope the rationalized guidelines. Therefore, the use of the simplified procedure in accordance with the rationalized guidelines was not against the Power Plant Assessment Ordinance and there were no procedural defects in the assessment of the impact of air pollution. Moreover, the Court stated that there were no reasons to predict that the level of the environmental impact would increase by the construction. The Court concluded that the Notice of Confirmation was legal as its content was adequate and there was no deviation nor abuse of power by the Minister.\r\n\r\nOn the same day, the Citizens’ Committee released a statement saying that the judgment was unjust, for the Court rejected the standing of the plaintiffs in relation to climate change and determined that the evaluation of PM 2.5 and consideration of the use of alternative fuels were not necessary.\r\n\r\nOn February 9, 2023, the citizens submitted a statement of appeal, and the following arguments are made in the appeal procedure. \r\n\r\nFirstly, the citizens claim that the judgment of the District Court did not recognize the danger of climate change as fact, although  the significant damage caused by climate change such as an increase in the number of extremely hot days and also an increase in the precipitation have been observed in their residential area.  They particularly emphasized the destruction of marine ecosystems due to the impact of climate change and the fact that fishermen are being deprived of their means of livelihood.\r\n\r\nSecondly, the citizens contest their lack of standing with regard to GHG emissions. The citizens argue that their health and living environment are exposed to risks and the interests to not suffer damage from GHG emissions should not be absorbed into public interests which do not assign standing but should be recognized as  individual concrete interests.\r\n\r\nThirdly, the citizens argue that the lack of consideration of the use of alternative fuels is a serious procedural flaw in the Notice of Confirmation. They also contest the District Court’s inadequately wide recognition of governmental discretion on issuing the alleged notice. \r\n\r\nFourthly, the citizens argue that there have been procedural flaws during the EIA, including the lack of consideration of carbon dioxide emissions at the planning phase. They also contend that the conducted assessment ignores the perspective of environmental conservation through transparency of the decision-making process and effective public participation, which is a fundamental requirement of EIA, and that the assessment did not examine the consistency with the Paris Agreement.\r\n\r\nFinally, the citizens argue that the use of the simplified EIA procedure is illegal since the present plan does not meet the criteria, such as the reduction of environmental impact as a result of the replacement of the power plants. \r\n\r\nOn February 22, 2024, the Tokyo High Court dismissed all of the citizensʼ (appellants) appeals. Firstly, regarding the non-recognition of the threat of climate change in the first instance judgment, the court recognized the danger of climate change as fact, citing both the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report and IPCC Special Report on Impacts of Global Warming of 1.5°. The court stated that \"Indeed, it is a serious and grave situation that climate change is causing weather disasters and changes in ocean conditions in various parts of the world, including Japan, and causing various damages to people.” On this point, the court acknowledged the effects of climate change on marine ecosystems, in response to the appellants' claims. Secondly, concerning the standing, the court stated that the Basic Matters relating to the Guidelines to be Established by the Competent Minister in Accordance with the Provisions of the EIA Act, as well as Ministerial Order of EIA, clearly treats GHG differently from other evaluation items for which studies, forecasts, and assessments should be conducted to ascertain the effects on human health and the living environment, with the aim of ensuring the protection of human health and the preservation of the living environment.\r\nConsequently, the court concluded that the regulations governing CO2 did not include the intent to protect the individual interests of each person. Furthermore, it stated that \"the interest to not suffer damage caused by global warming due to CO2 cannot be legally protected as concrete individual interests that are not absorbed by general public interests” because the alleged power plant is not considered to particularly increase the threat of damage in relation to a specific range of individuals. Thirdly, regarding the non-consideration of the alternatives of fuel sources, the court denied illegality because the based regulations of the conducted EIA \"only require consideration of multiple alternatives for the structure or layout of the power generation facilities, the location where the project will be implemented, or the scale of the project.” Fourthly, regarding the fact that carbon dioxide has not been selected as a consideration factor at the planning phase, the court stated that “The annual emissions of CO2 from the operation of the new power plant (approximately 7.26 million tCO2/year) are only about 1/5000th of the global CO2 emissions in 2015 and about 0.64% of Japan's total CO2 emissions in 2006. The CO2 emitted by the thermal power plant itself does not directly affect the environment. It causes climate change on a global scale in combination with emissions from other sources, to materialize natural disasters resulting various types of damage. Therefore, it is difficult to conclude that the CO2 emissions from the new power plant alone will significantly increase the scale or frequency of damage caused by disasters due to global warming.\" Additionally, the court noted that the alleged operator plans to adopt USE power generation equipment to reduce CO2 emissions. Further, the EIA Guideline for power plants states that CO2 is not an item that is expected to have a significant environmental impact in a typical project. Consequently, the court concluded that it was not illegal not to select CO2 as a consideration factor in the planning stage. Fifthly, regarding the application of the Improvement and Replacement Rationalization Guideline, the applied \"Simplified Replacement Assessment\" in this case is principally applicable in the case of replacement when the environmental impact has been reduced. In reality, however, the power plant before the replacement in this case had hardly been in operation since 2000. Thus, in 2015, when the construction of the two power plants was planned, the local air quality had improved considerably and stably. However, the court held that, even under these circumstances, a reduction in the actual environmental impact compared to recent operations was not a necessary requirement for the application of the Simplified Replacement Assessment. Therefore, there was nothing illegal in applying this type of Assessment on the grounds that emissions were lower than in 1970, when the plant was operating at maximum capacity.\r\n\r\nOn April 30, 2024, the plaintiffs appealed to the Supreme Court of Japan, claiming violation of human rights, due process, and procedural defect of environmental impact assessment. \r\n\r\nOn October 23, 2024, the Supreme Court rejected the request for a final appeal, and the judgment by the Tokyo High Court was upheld. The Supreme Court stated that it did not find grounds for a final appeal under Article 312 of the Code of Civil Procedure but no specific reasons were given.",

The complaint focuses on deforestation in five Amazonian regions: Loreto, Ucayali, Madre de Dios, Amazonas and San Martin. The plaintiffs argue that the situation is worse for Peruvians born between 2005 and 2011, whose futures are severely compromised due to the climate crisis. They assert that their fundamental right to enjoy a healthy environment has been violated, along with their rights to life, water, and health. \r\n\r\nThe plaintiffs' claims arise under article 2.22 of the Peruvian constitution; article 12.2 of the International Pact of Economic, Social and Cultural Rights; article 11 of the Additional Protocol of the American Convention on Human Rights; article 3 of the Code of Children and Adolescents; article I of Law no. 28611, General Law of the Environment; and article 15 of the Interamerican Democratic Charter.  \r\n\r\nThe complaint seeks an order directing the President, the Ministry of Environment, the Ministry of Agriculture and Irrigation, and the Ministry of Finance to create concrete goals and objectives to reduce net deforestation in the Peruvian Amazon to zero by 2025; an order directing the regional governments of Loreto, Ucayali, Madre de Dios, Amazonas and San Martin to develop regional action plans to reduce net deforestation to zero by 2025, including climate change adaptation and mitigation measures; an order requiring the Ministry of Agriculture and Irrigation to suspend granting deforestation permits on public lands in the five regions at issue until the national and regional plans have been created; recognition of the Peruvian Amazon as an entity subject to the rights of protection, conservation, maintenance and restoration; and a declaration that the situation of environmental conservation in the Peruvian Amazon is unconstitutional. \r\n\r\nOn April 24, 2025, the Superior Court of Lima issued a ruling stating that the case could proceed to a full merits analysis. This ruling rejected the Peruvian government’s attempts to halt the case, which were challenged and ultimately overturned on appeal. The state has continued to seek dismissal, contending that imposing deforestation targets or intervening in executive policymaking is beyond the judiciary’s authority.

The Committee concluded that the communication was admissible, but that New Zealand's decision was not clearly arbitrary, a manifest error, or a denial of justice. \r\n\r\nIn 2013, Ioene Teitiota, a Kiribati citizen, sought asylum in New Zeleand, asserting that the effects of climate change and sea level rise forced him to migrate. When the Immigration and Protection Tribunal denied his claim, he appealed to the New Zealand High Court. The High Court found that the impacts of climate change on Kirabati did not qualify Teitiota for refugee status because he was not subjected to persecution required for the 1951 United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees. Teitioa appealed the decision to the Court of Appeals. In dismissing the application, the Court of Appeals noted the gravity of climate change but stated that the Refugee Convention did not appropriately address the issue. Teitiota again appealed, this time before the Supreme Court of New Zealand. In 2015, the Supreme Court affirmed the lower courts’ conclusions, but did not rule out the possibility “that environmental degradation resulting from climate change or other natural disasters could [] create a pathway into the Refugee Convention or protected person jurisdiction.”\r\n\r\nOn September 15, 2015, Teitiota filed a communication with the UN Human Rights Committee, alleging that New Zealand had violated his right to life under the International Covenant on Social and Political Rights. He argued that sea level rise in Kiribati caused by climate change has created a scarcity of habitable space, resulting in violent land disputes, and environmental degradation including saltwater contamination of the freshwater supply.  On January 7, 2020, the Committee ruled that the communication was admissible because Teitiota had sufficiently substantiated his claim that when he was removed to Kiribati he faced an imminent risk of being arbitrarily deprived of his life due to the effects of sea level rise. The Committee reasoned that the requirement of imminence attaches to the decision to remove the individual, and not to the anticipated harm in the receiving state, although the latter is relevant in assessing the real risk faced by the individual. \r\n\r\nThe Committee dismissed the communication on the merits, however, explaining that it could only reverse a States party's determination that was clearly arbitrary or amounted to a manifest error or a denial of justice. The Committee reasoned that the risk of an arbitrary deprivation of life must be personal, rather than rooted in the general conditions of the receiving state, except in the most extreme cases. The Committee recognized that environmental degradation and climate change constitute serious threats to the ability of present and future generations to enjoy the right to life, but upheld New Zealand's determination that Teitiota had not provided evidence that he faced any real chance of being harmed in a land dispute, would be unable to grow food or access potable water, or otherwise faced life-threatening conditions.\r\n\r\nThe Committee did find, however, that \"given that the risk of an entire country becoming submerged under water is such an extreme risk, the conditions of life in such a country may become incompatible with the right to life with dignity before the risk is realized.\" Accepting Teitiota's claim that sea level rise is likely to render Kiribati uninhabitable, the Committee explained that given the 10-15 year timeframe, there was sufficient time for intervening acts by the government of Kiribati to protect its citizens. \r\n\r\nTwo Committee members dissented. One attacked the majority's reliance on the lack of evidence that Teitiota's family lacked potable water, explaining that \"potable\" does not equate to \"safe drinking water.\" The second argued that the Committee placed an unreasonable burden of proof on Teitiota to establish a real risk of danger of arbitrary deprivation of life.

      "type": "case",
      "count": 1,
      "summary": "On September 14, 2018, thirty-one families filed a lawsuit seeking an injunction to prevent the construction and operation of two units at a coal-fired plant in Kobe, Japan. The plaintiffs are represented by the Citizens' Committee on the Kobe Coal-Fired Power Plant and named Kobe Steel Ltd., Kobelco Power Kobe No. 2 Inc., and Kansai Electric Power Co., Inc. as defendants.  According to the plaintiffs, the new units would have a total output of 1,300 megawatts and emit 0.6% of the nation's carbon dioxide emissions from energy. They assert that the construction and operation of the new coal-fired units would violate the right to clean air and a healthy and clean environment, and the right to enjoy a stable climate; conflict with Japan's 2030 and 2050 climate targets; and pollute residential areas where air quality standards are already being violated.  \r\n\r\nOn March 20, 2023, the Kobe District Court delivered a judgment discussing the request for an injunction to the construction and operation of the coal-fired power plants. \r\n\r\nFirstly, the Kobe District Court discussed whether air pollution caused by the coal-fired power plants would violate the personal rights of the citizens. As for those Plaintiffs who live far from Kobe city, the Court said that there was no threat of a violation of personal rights to life, bodily integrity, and health by the emission of air pollutants from the power plants in question.  As for the other Plaintiffs, the Court examined whether there was a ‘concrete danger’ to determine a violation of personal rights. To determine this, the Court considered the Notice of Finalization that affirmed the assessment of SO2, NO2, SPM, and mercury and concluded that those substances would not create a concrete danger to the citizens. Further, regarding PM2.5, which was not included in the assessment, the Court considered the outcome of the simulation but did not recognize the existence of a concrete danger either. Consequently, the Court did not find a violation of personal rights to life, bodily integrity, and health. \r\n\r\nSecondly, the Kobe District Court determined whether air pollution caused by the coal-fired power plants would violate the right to a peaceful life. The Court repeated that there was no concrete danger to life or health and stated that granting an injunction based on non-serious anxiety about a healthy life could not limit socio-economic activities. Hence, the Court concluded that there was no violation of the right to a peaceful life.\r\n\r\nThirdly, the Court discussed whether climate change aggravated by using coal-fired power plants would violate personal rights. On this point, the Court states that climate change is likely to occur in Hyogo as the progression of global warming would affect the entire earth and the Plaintiffs may suffer damage. Yet, the Court continues by saying that there are many uncertain factors including the level of damage by disasters and the place where a disaster actually happens. Moreover, the Plaintiffs argued that the existence of a concrete danger should be judged by the level of danger of climate change by considering the carbon emission reduction targets by the international community. The Court stated that the concrete danger could not be equated with the danger of global warming as a whole since the concrete danger of damage to the Plaintiffs needed to be determined based on damage that global warming would cause to each individual whereas the reduction targets aimed at preventing global warming for the whole earth. \r\n\r\nFurther, the Court stated that the operation of the coal-fired power plants would not immediately render achieving the reduction targets impossible. Thus, the Court did not recognize the existence of a concrete danger to the Plaintiffs’ life, bodily integrity, and health, while it stated that there could be an abstract danger by the emission of CO2 that could aggravate global warming.\r\n\r\nLastly, the Court discussed whether climate change would violate the right to a peaceful life, or the right to a stable climate, which the Plaintiffs claimed as being included in the right to a peaceful life. First, the Court stated that the Plaintiffs’ anxiety about climate change was not serious, as it was about the uncertain danger in the future. Second, the Court said that the Plaintiffs’ claim was considered as a request to protect the environment in the absence of a concrete danger and that the right to a stable climate was not legally protected. Third, the Court stated that even if those points were affirmative, the responsibility could not be unilaterally attributed to the new coal-fired power plants in question. In conclusion, the Kobe District Court did not find grounds for an injunction. \r\n\r\nOn April 1, 2023, the citizens appealed the judgment. Thirty-four people appealed, and the process began on October 10, 2023. As their primary claim, the appellants sought an injunction against the operation of the power plant and an injunction against Kansai Electric Power's instructions to generate electricity. As a preliminary claim, they sought a phased emission reduction toward the future so that carbon dioxide emissions will be zero by 2040, since the international goal is to eliminate all coal-fired power plants worldwide by the same year.\r\n\r\nThe appellants, opposing the District Court decision, argued that their rights should be evaluated as being infringed by the state of being exposed to countless individual damages and the continuation of such a lifestyle, without actually having specific disasters. Specifically, the appellants insisted that \"being forced to live in a climate unstable world with a temperature increase of over 1.5 degrees Celsius, where life and health are in danger and social instability” itself is a violation of their rights. Moreover, they claimed that not all CO2 emissions are illegal, but only those that would make achieving the 1.5 °C target impossible. They alleged that the appellees’ emissions fall under this category.\r\n\r\nOn October 23, 2024, an expert witness's testimony on climate change was heard, and the pleadings concluded. \r\n\r\nOn April 24, 2024, the Osaka High Court dismissed the appeal. Regarding plaintiffs’ claim of an injunction based on personal rights in the context of climate change (the right to live a healthy and safe life in a world without a temperature increase of more than 1.5 degrees Celsius), the court acknowledged that the effects of climate change on life, body, health, etc. are not merely a matter of concern. Still, it held that the relationship is indirect and abstract, and that such legal interests cannot be incorporated into moral rights, because there is no concrete harm that could justify restricting the actions of others. As for causation, the court denied the legal causation between the climate harm claimed by the appellants and emissions from the defendant's plant because of the weakness and uncertainty in attributing liability to injure their social and economic activities.",

The plaintiffs also seek an order finding that the government has unlawfully failed to establish regulatory standards consistent with the Paris Agreement. \r\n\r\nOn March 15, 2021, the Osaka District Court rejected the plaintiffs’ request to cancel the Notice of Finalization issued by the Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry, concerning the construction plan of the new coal-fired Units based on two reasons. Firstly, the Court ruled that the plaintiffs lacked standing since there was a general rather individual public interest in the potential health damages caused by global warming. Secondly, the Court determined that the Notice of Finalization was not illegal as the decision of the Minister of Economy, Trade and Industry was neither deviation nor abuse of discretionary power.\r\n\r\nOn March 26, 2021, the citizens filed an appeal. In the Statement of Appeal, the Plaintiffs argued that the emission of GHG can be a violation of human rights of individuals as climate change damages a person’s life, body, and property. Moreover, they claim that the denial of standing is a violation of their right of access to the courts. Further, they demand the court to revisit the appropriateness of the environmental impact assessment and the Notice of Finalization. \r\n\r\nOn April 26, 2022, the Osaka High Court upheld the judgment by the Osaka District Court rejecting the request of the appellant’s to revoke the Notice of Finalization. In this judgment, the Osaka High Court discussed whether the appellants had standing under administrative law and whether the Notice of Finalization was illegal. Regarding the first point of the dispute, the court stated that there must a legally protected individual interest to have standing under administrative law. While the court recognized the standing of the appellants in relation to air pollution, the court ruled that the interest of the appellants do not include climate damage and that CO2 emissions are not recognized as a legally protected interest in the current society. The court further states that this interest should be pursued in the policy-making process as a general public interest. However, the court does not deny the possibility of a future change in this interpretation. If there is a change in the social situation or understanding, the interest to not incur damage through climate change and the CO2 emissions may be recognized as a legally protected individual interest.\r\n\r\nRegarding the second point, the legality of the Notice of Finalization, the court was not able to determine its legality based on the CO2 emissions as this was a policy issue. Moreover, concerning the lack of consideration of PM 2.5 emissions and concerns related to the emissions of other pollutants, the court stated that there was no deviation nor abuse of the discretionary power. Thus, the Notice of Finalization was legal. The citizens expressed their intent to further bring the case to the Supreme Court.\r\n\r\nOn May 6, 2022, the citizens filed a final appeal and asked the supreme court to reverse the judgment given on April 26, 2022.\r\n\r\nOn March 9, 2023, the Supreme Court rejected the request for a final appeal and the judgment by the Osaka High Court was upheld. The Supreme Court stated that it did not find grounds for a final appeal under Article 312 of the Code of Civil Procedure but no specific reasons were given.",

      "summary": "On January 30, 2020, the environmental group ClientEarth filed an action in the High Court challenging the UK government's decision to approve a natural gas plant, which would be Europe's largest. \r\n\r\nThe Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy approved the plant in October, despite the Planning Authority's recommendation that the plant be blocked due to climate change considerations. According to a press release issued by a barristers union, the complaint alleges, among other things, that the Secretary misinterpreted the Overarching National Policy Statement for Energy in assessing the project's greenhouse gas emissions; failed to properly assess the carbon-capture readiness of the facility; and did not consider the UK's mandate to achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 in a procedurally fair manner or, alternatively, failed to give adequate reasons for her assessment of the net zero target. The High Court gave ClientEarth permission to sue the government. \r\n\r\nThe High Court ruled for the defendants on May 22, 2020. The judge determined that the case involved policy questions requiring a balancing of interests, and that other public interests weigh against the UK's climate goals and for the plant's approval. These include the plant's contribution to security and diversity of energy supply. On July 21, 2020 the Court of Appeal granted ClientEarth leave to appeal the case.\r\n\r\nOn January 21, 2021, the Court of Appeal upheld the High Court's decision and rejected ClientEarth's appeal, finding that the government's approval of the plant was lawful. The Court of Appeal found that the Secretary of State balanced the adverse effects of the project, including greenhouse gas emissions, with the positive effects, including socioeconomic outcomes and re-use of existing infrastructure, and lawfully concluded that the benefits outweighed the adverse impacts. The Court of Appeal departed from the High Court in reasoning that greenhouse gas emissions are capable of being treated as \"a freestanding reason for refusal\" by the Secretary. Nevertheless, the Court reasoned that such emissions are not an \"automatic and insuperable obstacle\" to approval of infrastructure projects, and the decision-maker has discretion over the weight to assign to greenhouse gas emissions in approval decisions.

      "summary": "Two houses of the Wet’suwet’en indigenous group filed a legal challenge on February 10, 2020 alleging that the Canadian government's approach to climate change has violated their constitutional and human rights. \r\n\r\nAccording to the complaint, plaintiffs Misdi Yikh and Sa Yikh are each a House group under Wet’suwet’en indigenous law, and comprise the Fireweed Clan. The plaintiff Lho’imggin is the dinize’, or Head Chief, of Misdzi Yikh and the plaintiff Smogilhgim is the dini ze’ of Sa Yikh; each speaks for his House. \r\n\r\nThe plaintiff complaint allege that Canada failed to meet its international commitments to reduce greenhouse gases, including those made at the 1988 International Conference on the Changing Atmosphere and under the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the 1998 Kyoto Protocol, the 2009 Copenhagen Accord, the 2010 Cancun Agreement and the 2015 Paris Agreement. Plaintiffs further claim that Canada's Nationally Determined Contribution under the Paris Agreement -- to reduce annual greenhouse gas emissions by 30% below 2005 levels by 2030 -- is insufficient to meet its commitments to hold global warming below 2 degrees Celsius and pursue efforts to keep warming to 1.5 degrees. Moreover, according to plaintiffs, Canada appears unlikely to meet its Nationally Determined Contribution.  Finally, plaintiffs argue that Canada has failed to use discretionary decision-making power under its environmental assessment legislation to withhold approval of greenhouse gas emitting projects -- in particular liquefied natural gas exports facilities -- to help bring Canada's trajectory in line with the Paris Agreement targets.\r\n\r\nPlaintiffs contend that they have experienced significant warming effects on their territories and expect to experience negative health impacts due to climate change. They further assert that Canada's historical treatment of indigenous leaders and ongoing racial discrimination exacerbate the psychological and social trauma caused by climate change. Their claims arise principally under Section 91 of the Constitution Act, 1867 (duty to make laws for the peace, order and good government of Canada); Section 7 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms (right to life, liberty and security of person); and Section 15(1) of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms (equality before the law).\r\n\r\nPlaintiffs seek declaratory relief; an order requiring the government to amend each of its environmental assessment statutes that apply to extant high greenhouse gas emitting projects to allow project approval to be canceled if Canada will be unable to keep its Paris Agreement commitments or considers climate change to be a national emergency; and an order requiring the government to complete an annual account of its cumulative greenhouse gas emissions in a format that allows comparison to Canada's carbon budget. \r\n\r\nThe defendant Canada filed a motion to strike on July 28, 2020, and plaintiffs responded to the motion on September 10, 2020.\r\n\r\nOn November 16, 2020, the Federal Court granted the motion to strike without leave to amend on the grounds that the case was not justiciable, had no reasonable cause of action, and the remedies were not legally available. The Court found that the case was not justiciable because it did not have a sufficient legal component to anchor the analysis. The Court wrote, \"[t]he issue of climate change, while undoubtedly important, is inherently political, not legal, and is of the realm of the executive and legislative branches of government.\" The Court further found that because plaintiffs did not reference specific sections of laws that cause specific breaches of Charter rights, their claims presented no reasonable cause of action. With regard to remedies, the Court found that the multifaceted problem of climate change would make judicial supervision meaningless, and therefore the Court could not take on a supervisory role to ensure adequate laws were passed. \r\n\r\nOn December 10, 2020, plaintiffs appealed the Federal Court judge's dismissal to the Federal Court of Appeal, and on April 30, 2021, they filed their memorandum of fact and law. Canada responded with their memo of fact on law filed on June 28, 2021. ",

The request arises out of Article 2 and Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, Article 2 and Article 7 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and the principle of equality before the law. The submission also contains a request for preliminary ruling with the European Court of Justice regarding the legal nature of Article 37 of the Charter of Fundamental Rights.\r\n\r\nThe request asserts that the value-added tax exemption on cross-border flights and the kerosene exemption on national flights contribute to climate change by making it less expensive to fly than to take the train. The petitioners argue that the consequences of the climate crisis pose an imminent and foreseeable threat to their lives, and that Austria has a duty to protect its citizens from these consequences as a party to the Paris Agreement and based on its constitutional duty to protect arising out of the European Convention on Human Rights. Petitioners further argue that the challenged tax exemptions damage the climate and constitute an active infringement of this duty. The petition also alleges that the tax exemptions constitute a preferential treatment for the aviation sector, in violation of the constitutional principle of equality before the law. \r\n\r\nLastly, the petition includes a request for a preliminary ruling with the European Court of Justice, alleging that while both tax exemptions are allowed for, they are not explicitly provided for in the respective EU directives.

The court reasoned that the act was not a proper exercise of the national government's authority.\r\n\r\nAlberta filed suit in June 2019, arguing that the Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act, SC 2018, c. 12 (the Act) was unconstitutional because it does not fall within the national concern branch of the Parliament's peace, order and good government (POGG) power. The Act imposes a price on greenhouse gases by establishing a \"fuel charge\" on 22 greenhouse gas-emitting fuels, and an out-put based pricing system for industrial emitters.\r\n\r\nOntario, New Brunswick, Saskatchewan, Saskatchewan Power Corporation and SaskEnergy, Inc, intervened in support of Alberta’s position. They contended that the “matter” of the Act is properly understood to be the regulation of greenhouse gas emissions, and that to give the federal government exclusive authority over such a matter under the national concern doctrine would unduly intrude into the provinces’ jurisdiction to regulate their own natural resources.  Canada responded that it had the authority to enact the Act under the national concern doctrine, arguing that the Act's \"matter\" was in truth \"the establishment of minimal national standards of stringency for GHG emissions pricing to reduce Canada's nationwide GHG emissions.\" British Columbia and three nonprofits intervened to support Canada. \r\n\r\nThe court ruled for Alberta, concluding that the Act does not fall within the Canadian government's authority under the national concern doctrine. The court explained that the government cannot use the national concern doctrine to commandeer matters assigned exclusively to the provinces. Ultimately, the court determined that the “matter” of the Act is properly construed as the “regulation of greenhouse gas emissions,\" and the Act therefore interferes with provincial jurisdiction over natural resources, property and civil rights, local works and undertakings, and direct taxation.",

      "type": "case",
      "count": 1,
      "summary": "Michael John Smith (Ngāpuhi, Ngāti Kahu), climate change spokesperson for the Iwi Chairs' Forum, a Māori development platform, filed a case against seven high-emitting New Zealand companies in the agriculture and energy sectors: Fonterra Co-Operative Group Ltd , Genesis Energy Ltd, Dairy Holdings Ltd, New Zealand Steel Ltd, Z Energy Ltd, Channel Infrastructure NZ Ltd and BT Mining Ltd. Mr Smith claimed that the defendants' actions constituted (1) public nuisance, (2) negligence, and (3) breach of a duty to cease contributing to climate change.\r\n\r\nOn March 6, 2020, the High Court of New Zealand struck out the first two causes of action, but allowed the third to proceed. The court concluded that Mr Smith could not demonstrate public nuisance because the damage claimed was neither particular to him, nor the direct consequence of the defendants' actions. The court further reasoned that showing a public nuisance was difficult given that the defendants are complying with all relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. The court determined that Mr Smith's negligence claim must fail because he had not shown that the defendants owed him a duty of care, concluding that the damage claimed was not reasonably foreseeable or proximately caused by their actions.\r\n\r\nThe High Court declined to strike the third cause of action, which alleged that the defendants had a duty to cease contributing to climate change. The High Court found that there were \"significant hurdles\" for Mr Smith in persuading the court that this new duty should be recognised, but determined that the relevant issues should be explored at a trial. For instance, the court said perhaps the special damage rule in public nuisance could be modified, and climate science will result in increased ability to model possible effects of emissions. The High Court warned, however, that it would likely be unable to provide the injunctive relief that Mr Smith seeks, which would require a \"bespoke emission reduction scheme.\"\r\n\r\nFollowing the decision of the lower court, Mr Smith appealed the decision to strike out the first two causes of action, while the defendants cross-appealed the court's decision that the third cause of action should proceed to trial. On October 21 2021, the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal submitted by Mr Smith and upheld the cross appeal. The Court of Appeal held that tort law was not the appropriate vehicle for dealing with climate change, noting that \"every person in New Zealand - indeed, in the world - is (to varying degrees) both responsible for causing the relevant harm, and the victim of that harm\" ([18]). The Court of Appeal held that a determination that the conduct of the respondent companies was unlawful would introduce an \"ad hoc way of addressing climate change” and that it “is likely to result in arbitrary outcomes and ongoing litigation that lasts many years” ([27]), with climate change being a “striking example of a polycentric issue that is not amenable to judicial resolution” ([26]). The Court of Appeal did note that the courts have some role in climate action: \"in holding the government to account\", however “it is not the role of the courts to develop a parallel common law regulatory regime that is ineffective and ineffective, and likely to be socially unjust” ([35]). \r\n\r\nMr Smith applied for leave to bring an appeal to the New Zealand Supreme Court. On 31 March 2022, the Supreme Court granted leave to appeal, on the question of whether the Court of Appeal was correct to dismiss the appeal and allow the cross-appeal. The appeal was heard in the Supreme Court in August 2022. \r\n\r\nOn 7 February 2024, the Supreme Court released its decision. The Supreme Court unanimously allowed Mr Smith’s appeal, and reinstated his statement of claim. The Supreme Court held that the application of orthodox, long-settled principles governing strike out applications meant that Mr Smith’s claim should be allowed to proceed to trial, rather than being struck out preemptively. \r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court held that there was no basis to conclude that the law or torts (and in particular, public nuisance) in the realm of climate change in Aotearoa New Zealand had been displaced by statute ([101]). Neither the Climate Change Response Act 2002 nor the Resource Management Act 1991 (New Zealand’s primary environmental legislation) had that effect. Rather, Parliament had left a pathway open for the common law to operate, develop and evolve amid that statutory landscape ([101]). \r\n\r\nPublic nuisance claim\r\nRegarding the public nuisance claim, and whether it was bound to fail, the Supreme Court identified four specific questions to better identify whether the claim could reasonably succeed. \r\n\r\nFirst, the Supreme Court analysed whether Mr Smith had plausibly identified public rights that were being interfered with. The Court observed that the rights pleaded by Mr Smith (rights to public health, public safety, public comfort, public convenience and public peace) fell tenably within or had sufficient relation to the particular rights traditionally identified as providing foundation for a public nuisance pleading ([145]). \r\n\r\nSecondly, the Court affirmed the Court of Appeal’s finding that public nuisance need not involve otherwise illegal activity - it does not require the act or omission complained of to be independently unlawful ([147]). \r\n\r\nThird, the Supreme Court considered the ‘special damage rule’, which requires a private plaintiff to have suffered “special damage” to bring a public nuisance claim. It is a rule of standing. The Supreme Court noted whether this rule should remain part of the law ([151]), however even if it did, Mr Smith had a tenable claim to meeting its present requirements because of damage to coastal land in which he, and others he represents, claim legal and distinct tikanga interests ([152]).\r\n\r\nFinally, the Court considered whether causation is required for public nuisance. While the Court of Appeal considered that “climate change simply cannot be appropriately or adequately addressed by common law tort claims”, the Supreme Court held that “while it may indeed be beyond the capacity of the common law to resolve climate change in fact, but we are not presently convinced, at this stage of the proceeding, addressing only strike out, that the common law is incapable of addressing tortious aspects of climate change” (154]).  The Supreme Court referred to a number of authorities which suggested it was arguable that, in the case of public nuisance, a defendant must take responsibility for its contribution to a common interference with public rights, and that its responsibility should not be contingent on the absence of co-contribution or be in effect discharged by the equivalent acts of others ([164]). The Supreme Court noted that the causation problems presented by Mr Smith’s claims were fundamentally similar to other public nuisances involving multiple contributors, such as industrial revolution air and water pollution cases, stating that “climate change engages comparable complexities, albeit at a quantum leap scale of enlargement” (at [157]). \r\n\r\nHaving found that Mr Smith had shown enough to show a reasonable public nuisance case, the Court permitted the two remaining causes of action - negligence and the proposed novel climate duty, to also proceed to trial. On the potential role of tikanga, the Court held that whatever the cause of action, addressing and assessing matters of tikanga at trial could not be avoided ([188]). \r\n\r\nThe case was referred back to the High Court to proceed to trial. \r\n\r\nOn 16 April 2025, the High Court released a decision regarding interlocutory applications. The first, by the first to third defendants, sought that the Court determine whether, as a matter of principle, if it is properly arguable that the applicants are entitled to join to the proceeding as third parties, overseas entities falling within any of the following three categories: overseas commercial emitters, overseas government emitters, and overseas non-profit emitters (“Third Party Application”).\r\n\r\nFurther, the first to fifth defendants sought orders that the proceedings be declared a “universal representative proceeding”, with all defendants being sued on behalf of all persons with the same interest in the subject matter - namely, all New Zealand entities which, “as part of commercial profit-making enterprises”, produce GHG emissions, or supply or produce products that, when used, produce GHG emissions, and whose emissions “are significantly greater than the emissions of an ordinary New Zealand citizen” (“Universal Representative Application”). \r\n\r\nRegarding the Third Party Application, in declining the application, the High Court found that granting the application would be inconsistent with the objective of the High Court Rules - the just, speedy and inexpensive determination of any proceeding - as well as the fundamental principle of access to justice ([49]). The inevitable consequence of joinder third parties would be complexity, expense, and delay - and a very high likelihood that the trial scheduled for April 2027 would not proceed.\r\n\r\nTurning to the Universal Representative Application, the High Court found that the Supreme Court’s decision had clearly anticipated and proceeded on the assumption that Mr Smith was proceeding against particular defendants ([60]), with the clear effect of the Supreme Court’s judgment being that Mr Smith is able to bring a claim against only the named defendants. Instead, the Universal Representative Application effectively sought to relitigate the same issue ([61]). Further, the principle of access to justice would not be enhanced by making a representative order ([74]). ",

South Korea's Framework Act on Low Carbon, Green Growth, which was amended in December 2019, commits to reducing annual nationwide greenhouse gases to 536 million tons by 2030, a 24% cut from 2017. The petitioners argue that this target is insufficient to keep global warming below 2 degrees Celsius. \r\n\r\nThe petitioners submitted a supplemental complaint on May 15, 2020, to provide the Court with info on the facts and science of climate change, and, in their view, Korea's insufficient response to the threat.\r\n\r\nOn September 28, 2020, the petitioners submitted a supplemental brief to provide the Court with updated info on recent severe climate impacts in South Korea, the need for a prompt hearing of the case, and the Irish Supreme Court's handling of a similar case in Friends of the Irish Environment v. Ireland. On January 26, 2021, the petitioners filed a second supplemental brief with arguments on the South Korean government's violation of its obligation to protect citizens from the harms of climate change. The brief argues that the obligation to respond to climate change is derived from the Korean constitution's guarantee of the right to a healthy environment, the obligation to prevent disasters, and the obligation to protect health and safety. Petitioners argue that the government has violated this obligation by failing to enact adequate and effective climate legislation, and that petitioners have standing to challenge legislative omissions due to inadequate protection of environmental rights. On April 15, 2021, the plaintiffs submitted a third supplemental brief presenting arguments that the climate change law and enforcement of that law are underprotecting their basic rights and are violating their equal rights.\r\n\r\nOn February 15, 2024, this case, 2020Hun-Ma389, was consolidated with three others: 2021Hun-Ma1264, 2022Hun-Ma854, and 2023Hun-Ma846.\r\n\r\nOn August 29, 2024, in a unanimous decision, the Constitutional Court found that Article 8 Paragraph 1 of the Framework Act on Carbon Neutrality and Green Growth violates the right to healthy environment under Article 35 of the Constitution, and ordered the National Assembly to amend the law by February 28, 2026. \r\n\r\nThe Constitutional Court first acknowledged that the right to healthy environment under Art. 35 of the Constitution addresses the harm and risks related to climate change and that the State has an obligation to protect such rights by mitigating the cause of climate change and reducing the harm by adapting to climate change. The Court then ruled that in order to appropriately address such issue, the State's measures on climate change (i) must be based on South Korea's share of efforts in light of the global efforts based on scientific facts and international standards, (ii) should not impose excessive burden to the future, and (iii) must be based on legal framework that ensures continuous reduction of greenhouse gas. \r\n\r\nIn light of these standards, the Court ruled that Art. 8 Paragraph 1 of the Act has failed to meet these standards by not prescribing any targets or plans between the period 2031 - 2049, which inevitably results in postponing of reduction efforts. The Court also ruled that the provision violated the \"principle of legislative reservation\" stating that the the framework of the reduction pathway up to 2050 must be set by law, by the Legislature, considering its implications on various fundamental rights, and the fact that the future generation has limited opportunity to present its interest in the process.\r\nOn the 2030 reduction target set by the Enforcement Decree, the Court ruled that it is unable to identify a single standard or criteria to determine the appropriate share of South Korea in the global efforts and therefore cannot conclude that the target is in violation of the State's obligation. However, the Court also stated that it does not mean the State is doing its best on climate mitigation.\r\n\r\nOn the Carbon Neutrality Plan, the Court was divided. The majority, 5 justices, opined the Carbon Neutrality Plan is unconstitutional because the 40% reduction is based on \"gross emission\" of the base year 2018, and \"net emission\" of the target year 2030. Because the base year excludes carbon removal by LULUCF and the target year includes carbon removal by LULUCF, the majority opinion ruled that the actual reduction efforts of the plan does not meet the stated 40% and has violated the mandate of the Enforcement Decree. On the other hand, 4 justices dismissed the claim stating that because the language of the provision of the Act did not distinguish gross emission and net emission, such discrepancy would not amount to unconstitutionality. As the Constitutional Court Act requires super-majority (2/3) for decision of unconstitutionality, the claim on Carbon Neutrality Plan was dismissed. \r\n",

      "summary": "The European Union’s (EU) Directive 2003/87 established a scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading at the EU level (ETS).  As the ETS developed, it had a growing structural imbalance in the supply and demand of allowances, resulting in an excess that could reach around 2 billion allowances.\r\n\r\nIn October 2014, the European Council adopted an instrument to stabilize the market as part of the ETS called a \"market stability reserve.”  These reserves would not be released unless the total number of allowances in circulation was less than 400 million.  The market stability reserve would result in an increase in the price of emission allowances.  When adopting this measure, the Council did not adopt it under a special legislative procedure pursuant to Article 192(2)(c) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU).  That procedure is required if the Council adopts \"measures significantly affecting a Member State's choice between different energy sources and the general structure of its energy supply.\"  \r\n\r\nIn 2016 Poland filed an application with the European Court of Justice arguing that the decision should be annulled as it should have been adopted under a special legislative procedure.  Poland is particularly reliant on fossil fuels and this decision significantly affects Poland's choice between different energy sources and the general structure of its energy supply.  An increase in emission allowance prices could lead to a change in the competitiveness of various types of power stations and in the structure of electricity production at a national level, and to a decrease in the competitiveness of the energy sector and the Polish economy.  The Court rejected this argument, holding that the aim and content of the contested decision was not to have the primary outcome of significantly affecting Poland's choice between different energy sources and the general structure of its energy supply.\r\n\r\nPoland also argued that the European Council had set the date of the application of the market stability reserve at 2021, and that the defendants, by bringing forward the date to 2019, breached article 15 of TEU and infringed the obligation of sincere cooperation.  The Court ruled that there was no reference in the Council's decision to starting the market stability reserve at 2021 and rejected the argument.  Poland also argued the infringement of legal certainty, protection of legitimate expectations and principle of proportionality, all of which the Court also rejected.  \r\n",

      "summary": "Trinseo operates an installation for the production of polycarbonate. That installation obtains the steam needed for that production from a plant which is operated, on the same site, by another company, Dow Deutschland Anlagengesellschaft.  On 23 January 2012, Trinseo applied to the German Emissions Trading Authority for the free allocation of emission allowances. By decision of 17 February 2014, the German authority refused that application, on the ground that polycarbonate is not included in the list of substances and groups of substances referred to in the provision of the German legislation transposing Directive 2003/87/CE, which establishes a scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading within the European Community.\r\n\r\nOn 2 October 2015, Trinseo brought an action against that decision before the Berlin Administrative Court and claimed that the directive at issue shall be interpreted as including in its scope all activities for the production of bulk organic chemicals without any limitation to specific substances. The Administrative Court of Berlin referred to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) a question regarding the interpretation of Article 1 and Annex I of the Directive 2003/87/CE and its scope of application.\r\n\r\nThe ECJ observed that, according to Article 2(1) of Directive 2003/87, the activities referred to in Annex I of the directive fall within the scope of that directive only if they generate greenhouse gas emissions. Yet, the production of polycarbonate by an installation, which imports heat from a third-party installation, does not generate direct emissions of CO2 and cannot rely on the ‘indirect emissions’ generated by the third-party. The ECJ has therefore ruled that Article 2(1) of Directive 2003/87 must be interpreted as meaning that an installation for the production of polycarbonate, which obtains the heat needed for that production from a third-party installation, does not fall within the scope of the emissions allowance trading scheme established by that directive, since it does not generate direct CO2 emissions. Accordingly, Trinseo is not entitled to free allocation of emissions trading allowances. \r\n",

By decision of February 19, 2014, the German Authority refused to allocate allowances free of charge for process emissions stemming from the combustion of liquid waste, claiming that only gaseous waste is entitled to such emissions according to the German legislation transposing Directive 2003/87/CE, which establishes a scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading within the European Community.\r\n\r\nOn September 29, 2015, INEOS brought an action against that decision before the Berlin Administrative Court.

By decision of 17 February 2014, the German authorities made a decision to allocate Evonik Degussa allowances for the years 2013-2020, which decision made clear that the activity of extracting hydrogen from rich gas was not taken into account for the purposes of the allocation. By decision of 25 August 2015, the German authorities confirmed their original decision on the ground, inter alia, that the hydrogen was already present in the rich gas source streams, and it was not the result of a production by Evonik Degussa. Evonik Degussa appealed this decision before the Administrative Court in Berlin. The dispute in the main proceedings concerns whether the production of hydrogen by purification of rich gases ought to have been taken into account for the allocation of allowances. Evonik Degussa claims it should, relying in particular on the wording of the product benchmark for hydrogen and the definition of that product set out in Annex I, Part 2, to Decision 2011/278. \r\n \r\nThe Administrative Court, Berlin, referred the question to the Court of Justice whether Annex I, Part 2, to Decision 2011/278 must be interpreted as meaning that a process element which does not produce hydrogen by chemical synthesis, but only isolates hydrogen already contained in a gas mixture, falls within the system boundaries of the product benchmark for hydrogen.\r\n \r\nThe Court found that Annex I, Part 2, to Decision 2011/278 determining transitional Union-wide rules for harmonized free allocation of emission allowances pursuant to Article 10a of Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council must be interpreted as meaning that a process, such as that at issue here, which does not produce hydrogen by chemical synthesis, but only isolates hydrogen already contained in a gas mixture, does not fall within the system boundaries of the product benchmark for hydrogen. It would be otherwise only if that process: first, is associated with the “production of hydrogen” within the meaning of Annex I to Directive 2003/87/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 October 2003 establishing a scheme for greenhouse gas emission allowance trading within the Community and amending Council Directive 96/61/EC, as amended by Directive 2009/29/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 April 2009; and, second, has a technical connection to the “production of hydrogen.”\r\n",

In addition to EU ETS requirements, the government of Slovakia imposed an 80% tax on emissions allowances that were transferred or unused, and therefore allocated free of charge. This tax was applied between 1 January 2011 and 30 June 2012.\r\n\r\nPPC Power requested that the Tax Administration for Certain Taxpayers, Slovakia (\"the DU\"), set the amount of the advance of tax payable for 2011 at zero because the legislation establishing the 80% tax rate was incongruous with EU Directive 2003/87/EC. The DU rejected PPC Power's request and set its advance payment amount for the first half of 2011 to EUR300,000. PPC Power applied for repayment of that amount and, when that decision was ultimately rejected by the DU, PPC Power filed suit with the Regional Court of Bratislava, contesting, on the one hand, the decision of the Slovak Republic tax administration rejecting its application for repayment of the advance payment of tax for the first half of 2011 and, on the other, the decision of the DU, setting the amount of advance payment of tax due in respect of the second half of 2011. The Regional Court  referred the question to the European Court of Justice (“ECJ”), whether Directive 2003/87 must be interpreted as precluding national tax legislation, such as that at issue in the main proceedings.\r\n\r\nThe ECJ ruled that Directive 2003/87/EC \"must be interpreted as precluding national legislation, such as that at issue in the main proceedings, which taxes, at 80% of their value, greenhouse gas emission allowances allocated free of charge which have been sold or not used by the undertakings subject to the greenhouse gas emission trading scheme.\" The ECJ acknowledged that Directive 2003/87/EC requires member states to allocate at least 90% of emissions allowances free of charge but still allows member states to determine procedures for allocating them. However, the ECJ found that, the Slovakian tax eliminated \"virtually all of the economic value of emission allowances,\" and therefore negated the incentive mechanisms underpinning the EU ETS. To reduce emissions in the manner prescribed by the EU ETS, the ECJ ruled, Directive 2003/87/EC must be interpreted as precluding national legislation such as Slovakia's at issue in the proceedings.\r\n",

The court cited a study suggesting that 40% of the glacial retreat could be attributed to Black Carbon impact and concluded that, therefore, Black Carbon emission reduction can address glacial melting. The court concluded that Indian citizens have the right to a wholesome, clean and decent environment, derived from Article 48A of the Constitution (which requires the state to protect and improve the environment), Article 51A (requiring a citizen to protect and improve the natural environment) and Article 21 (protecting the right to life as a fundamental right).\r\n\r\nAlthough the court described how greenhouse gas emissions cause global warming, and affirmed the applicability of the “polluter pays” principle to the respondents in this case, the court did not assign Himachal Pradesh responsibility for mitigating global warming per se.

The wind farm was expected to damage part of the forest cover and several protected species. The developer sought an exemption from the prohibition against harming natural habitats and protected animal and plant species under the French Environmental Code. Such an exemption may be granted “in the interest of public health and safety or for other imperative reasons of overriding public interest, including of a social or economic nature.\" However, case law consistently holds that, even where such a public interest exists, a waiver can only be granted if there is no satisfactory alternative solution and it does not prejudice the maintenance of the affected species.\r\n\r\nThe prefect of Morbihan granted the waiver. Two local associations -- Society for the Protection of Landscapes and Aesthetics of France and Society for the Study and Protection of Nature in Brittany -- along with several local residents brought an action for annulment of this decree. The lower court granted their requests and annulled the order; the ACA then overturned the judgment after the developer appealed. \r\n\r\nThe ACA reasoned that the wind farm increases the production of renewable energy, making it easier to meet the objectives of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and combating climate change provided by legislation, by regional planning instruments, by European-level position papers, and by international agreements. The ACA also noted the region’s high energy dependency. Thus, taking into account this local context and the need to meet the objectives of developing renewable energy, the court ruled that the project must be considered as meeting an imperative reason of major public interest likely to justify the harm to protected species. The court also analyzed the measures to avoid, reduce, compensate for and monitor the project's impacts on the protected areas, and concluded that their implementation would allow the maintenance of the species concerned in a favorable conservation status.\r\n",

The decision was affirmed on July 31.\r\n\r\nEnvironmental campaigner Christopher Packham filed suit on March 27, 2020 to challenge the Secretary of State for Transport's decision to approve the HS2 rail project, a national high-speed railway network to connect London, Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds. The claimaint sought an interim injunction to prevent imminent clearance works in six different woodlands. He brought a number of claims related to a report analyzing \"whether and how HS2 should proceed.\" The claimant alleged, among other things, that the report failed to properly account for expected greenhouse gas emissions during construction of the project; and failed to address the project's effects on greenhouse gas emissions during the period leading up to 2050, and not just in 2050 and beyond, in accordance with the Paris Agreement and the Climate Change Act 2008. At an April 3 hearing, the court determined that claimant did not have a realistic prospect of success; on April 6 it issued written reasons for its decision. The court rejected all claims, including the claim based on greenhouse gas emissions. \r\n\r\nThe court first explained that the report at issue did adequately consider greenhouse gas emissions by assessing the short-term impacts of construction as well as the longer-term effects of providing a mode of transport that is less carbon-intensive than alternatives, such as aviation. The court also rejected the claimant's assertion that the report misrepresented a study by the project's \"nominated undertaker\" by failing to convey that construction emissions would not be at the \"low emissions\" end of the possible range, reasoning that the study simply gave a range of possible greenhouse gas emissions that the report fairly summarized. The court concluded that the defendants, therefore, did not fail to take into account a relevant factor that they were legally required to consider. \r\n\r\nSecond, the court dismissed the claimant's argument that both the report assessing H2S and the decision to approve the project failed to address the importance of greenhouse gas emissions in the period leading up to 2050, which is referred to in the Paris Agreement. The court reasoned that the report did consider the effects of the project before and after 2050 resulting from construction and the first 60 years of operation. The court distinguished Plan B Earth v. Secretary of State, in which the Secretary of State admitted that he had not considered the Paris Agreement in approving the expansion of Heathrow Airport. \r\n\r\nOn July 31, 2020, the Court of Appeal refused permission to appeal, reasoning that none of the claimant's claims were arguable.

      "summary": "On April 20, 2020, Bushfire Survivors for Climate Action brought a civil enforcement proceeding to compel the New South Wales Environmental Protection Authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. The plaintiffs, represented by the New South Wales Environmental Defenders Office, are Australians who allege that they have been harmed by bush fires made likely or more intense by climate change. The case was brought under the New South Wales Protection of the Environment Operations Act ( 1997 (\"PEOA\"), which requires the Environmental Protection Authority to “develop environmental quality objectives, guidelines and policies to ensure environment protection.\" The summons alleges that, although the New South Wales Climate Change Policy framework endorses the Paris Agreement and contains an aspirational long-term objective to achieve net zero emissions by 2050, the New South Wales Environmental Protection Authority has failed to develop guidelines or a policy to regulate greenhouse gases consistent with limiting global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius. \r\n\r\nOn June 4 the respondent filed its points of defense, asserting that it has complied with its duty by developing guidelines and policies from time to time to address greenhouse gas emissions. \r\n\r\nOn November 4, 2020, the Court issued an order allowing testimony from the plaintiff's expert, Australian Chief Scientist Professor Penny Sackett, on climate change, including whether emissions trajectories in New South Wales and Australia are on track to limit warming to 1.5 degrees. According to the plaintiffs, this marks the first time an Australian court has ruled on whether climate evidence can be heard in a case alleging the government's failure to perform their statutory duty. \r\n\r\nOn August 26, 2021, the Court ordered the New South Wales Environmental Protection Authority (\"EPA\") \"to develop environmental quality objectives, guidelines and policies to ensure environment protection from climate change.\" The Court found that the POEA's duty to develop environmental protection instruments includes the duty to develop climate change protection instruments. The Court pointed to evidence presented by Professor Penny Sackett, and the IPCC reports which she relied on, to conclude that \"the threat to the environment of climate change is of sufficiently great magnitude and sufficiently great impact as to be one against which the environment needs to be protected.\" The EPA had failed to fulfill its duty to protect from this threat because none of the instruments it presented adequately provided for protection from climate change. The documents it presented were either not prepared by the EPA or were \"directed towards ancillary or insignificant causes or consequences of climate change.\"",

(Mizuho), Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation (SMBC) and Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Inc. (MUFG) breached the Guidelines with regard to their financing of coal power plants in Vietnam. The complaints allege that SMBC, MUFG and Mizuho are in breach of OECD guidelines because they failed to provide environmental and social impact assessments and consequently failed to urge project sponsors to assess and prevent or minimize environmental damage. They claim that the project’s emissions intensity (estimated at 860-880g CO2/kWh) is of an unacceptably high level by international standards, and would generate twice as much CO2 per unit of power generated as the average electricity generating plant in Vietnam. In addition they allege that banks were made aware about the environmental impacts of the project, but there is no evidence that they took any steps to influence their client to disclose additional environmental information or to implement additional mitigation measures that would reduce the project’s emissions. Further, they failed to adequately consult communities that were affected by the coal-fired power stations. \r\n\r\nOn February 21, 2020, the NCP carried out an initial assessment and decided to further examine the issues raised by Market Forces, except for the issues concerning Vung Ang 2 and the Nam Dinh 1 projects, for which no loan agreements by the enterprises Involved were substantiated. Subsequently, the NCP conducted interviews and decided to hold a dialogue through mediation with the consent of both parties. On July 15, 2020, a dialogue was held online. Regarding Nghi Son 2 coal-fired power project and the Van Phong 1 coal-fired power project, issues related to stakeholder engagement, disclosure obligations, environment, and human rights were discussed. Market Forces requested the enterprises to conduct an independent review on human rights and environment, reinvestigate the process towards the loan agreement, and shift their financing policy in Vietnam to exclude coal-fired projects and help to increase the renewable energy capacity. In response, the enterprises said that they were not directly involved with the projects as they were lenders rather than sponsors or shareholders. Further, they claimed that they were encouraging the project sponsors to honor the environmental and social consideration and stakeholder engagement. While the parties mutually recognized the importance of complying with the Equator Principles and conducting appropriate due diligence, they still had a gap in their position concerning disclosure. During the mediation, the parties did not reach an agreement concerning the issues yet decided to proceed with the final statement without holding a second dialogue.\r\n\r\nOn January 15, 2021, the NCP issued a final statement concluding the process as there was no agreement of the parties to solve issues.",

Thus, approval of the mine would be unlawful. The Galilee Coal Project had received federal approval but needed a recommendation that it be approved by the Queensland Land Court before the environmental authority and mining lease could be granted by the Queensland Department of Environment and Science and Minister for Resources, respectively. The recommendations are not finally determinative but must be considered by the Minister for Natural Resources Mines and Energy and by the Chief Executive of the Department of Environment and Science when making a final decision on the mining lease.\r\n \r\nOn August 28, 2020, the court denied the defendant's motion to dismiss the case.

The plaintiff Friends of the Irish Environment had argued, among other things, that the Government failed to properly analyze the NPF's impact on climate change. \r\n\r\nIn February 2018 the Government of Ireland published the NPF which, along with the National Development Plan, maps out the general goals for Ireland for the period leading up to 2040.  In the course of preparing the NPF the Government developed a strategic environmental assessment (SEA). Ten National Strategic Outcomes were identified: Compact Growth, Enhanced Regional Accessibility, Strengthened Rural Economies and Communities, High Quality International Connectivity, Sustainable Mobility, A Strong Economy, Enhanced Amenities and Heritage, Transition to Sustainable Energy, Sustainable Management of Water, Waste and other environmental resources, and Access to Quality Child Care, Education and Health Services. The Government determined that a policy option called Regional Effectiveness and Settlement Diversity would best suit the needs of the country in achieving the National Strategic Outcomes while accounting for projected population growth. \r\n\r\nIn May 2018, Friends of the Irish Environment filed this action against the Government of Ireland; the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government; and the Attorney General. The group challenged the NPF on a number of grounds, including that the Government failed to assess the NPF's effects on climate change when preparing the SEA. The complaint alleged that the government was required to not only identify the likely increases in greenhouse gas emissions that would occur under the NPF, but also analyze the climate impacts of those emissions. The court rejected this claim, reasoning that a quantitative assessment of the NPF's likely effect on climactic factors is not feasible because the NPF is a policy document that does not permit any specific development or project. The court further reasoned that the NPF does contain provisions designed to reduce the effects of climate change that the NPF causes. The court concluded that the SEA's consideration of climate change was therefore sufficient. ",

      "count": 1,
      "summary": "In May 2020, the Tartu Administrative Court allowed a complaint by Fridays for Future Estonia (officially MTÜ Loodusvõlu), an organization of young Estonian climate activists, seeking to nullify a permit issued to the state-owned energy group Eesti Energia for the construction of a new shale oil plant. Shale oil is a fossil fuel produced from oil shale (a coal-like fossil fuel found in Estonia) and exported outside the EU to be used as fuel on long-range ships. \r\nFridays for Future alleged that the municipality of Narva-Jõesuu issued the construction permit without adequately assessing its climate impacts and the commitments made under the Paris Agreement, as well as the European Union's objective to achieve climate neutrality by 2050. The court named two Eesti Energia subsidiaries as third parties, and the Ministry of the Environment (now Ministry of Climate) as an administrative body.\r\nThe courts of first and second instance did not uphold Fridays for Future’s complaint, stating that the construction permit does not cover carbon emissions from the use of the oil produced in the plant, but only the impacts of the construction activity itself. The circuit court also stated that a construction permit does not regulate the use of the building in the future, but only the process of construction and the impacts that it causes.\r\nThey also denied two requests for preliminary injunction to halt construction of the plant as not currently justified because the plaintiff's claims relate to impacts that would occur during the plant's operation, rather than construction. However, the Tartu Circuit Court granted a preliminary injunction in May 2021 and temporarily suspended the construction permit after it appeared that the impacts of the construction to the nearby Natura 2000 area had not been thoroughly assessed. Around two months later the injunction was lifted and the construction continued.\r\nIn 2022, the Supreme Court of Estonia accepted the complaint but denied a request for preliminary injunction.\r\nOn October 11, 2023, the Supreme Court upheld the claim and nullified the construction permit. Although the case was mostly built on climate arguments, especially on the shortcomings of climate impact assessment, and most of the Supreme Court’s judgement focuses on climate change matters, the court eventually did not nullify the construction permit on climate change grounds, but because there were other deficiencies with the environmental impact assessment, such as the failure to evaluate the impact on another Natura 2000 area and to evaluate climate sensitivity (or resilience) of the installation.\r\nFor the first time in Estonia, the Supreme Court stated that the mitigation of climate change is a constitutional obligation. More precisely, that the Estonian constitution requires a proportionate contribution to the Paris climate agreement goal to keep the global average temperature increase significantly below two degrees, preferably within 1.5 degrees of pre-industrial levels.\r\nThe court stated that the emissions of the plant should be compared to Estonian national climate targets to assess whether the plant’s climate impact is unacceptably large. Therefore, Scope 3 emissions that are emitted outside the borders of Estonia do not need to be accounted for. The court also explained that the oil plant operator's participation in the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS) may not be sufficient to meet Estonia's national climate targets and additional national targets may be necessary.\r\nIn 2020, when the permit was issued, Estonia had very relaxed climate targets. The court considered it justified to base the climate impact assessment on these and did not agree that the authority should have taken into account the EU climate neutrality target, because despite the government agreeing to it, at the time it was not legally binding. The Supreme Court found that the construction of the plant does not obviously prevent Estonia from fulfilling these relaxed targets, therefore the climate impact was not the reason to nullify the permit. However, the court explicitly noted that when the integrated environmental permit is issued in the near future, the related impact assessment must be based on the recently updated stricter climate targets. \r\nThe court made it clear that the authority must deny a permit to a project with a significant climate impact unless there is an overriding ‘existential state interest’ that would outweigh it. Otherwise it will unduly restrict the freedoms of individuals or the public interest in the future to curb climate change. The greater the risk of missing the climate targets, the greater must be the overriding interest. The court implied that if the risk of meeting the climate targets cannot be clearly excluded, the authority should not grant a permit to this project, because in the view of the court, in the case in question no such ‘existential state interest’ can be detected at present.\r\nThe court ordered the municipality of Narva-Jõesuu to assess the environmental impacts that had not been properly assessed before and decide again whether to grant a new construction permit.",

The letter urged the Secretaries to consider whether the Energy NPSs are still appropriate under section 6(1) of the Planning Act 2008 in light of changed circumstances. These changed circumstances include an amendment to the Climate Change Act 2008 (2050 Target Amendment), in June 2019, to require that the UK achieves carbon neutrality by 2050; the Paris Agreement; the IPCC special report on 1.5 degrees of warming; the UK Parliament's declaration of a climate emergency; and the UK's exit from the European Union.

The plaintiffs claim that the fund has not approved any project since 2019, although resources are available and projects are awaiting technical analysis. They further allege that between 2019 and 2020, important mechanisms that allowed the functioning and management of the Amazon Fund were extinguished, namely: the Technical Committee of the Amazon Fund (CTFA), responsible for calculating deforestation and the amount of carbon emitted, and the Steering Committee of the Amazon Fund (COFA), the Fund's governance body.\r\n\r\nThe plaintiffs rely on the common duty of the Federal Government, the States, the Federal District and the Municipalities to “protect the environment and fight pollution in any of its forms” and “to preserve forests, fauna and flora” per the Federal Constitution of 1988, as well as the precautionary principle. They also allege a violation of Article 225 of the Federal Constitution, regarding the State's duties to: preserve and restore ecological processes; promote the ecological management of ecosystems; define territorial spaces and its components to be specially protected; and protect fauna and flora. The petition also seeks an injunction to require that Federal Union take the necessary administrative measures to reactivate the operation of the Amazon Fund.\r\n\r\nIn June 2020 the Supreme Court admitted the lawsuit and requested the federal and state government actors involved to provide information related to: (i) the management and distribution of Fund resources; (ii) activities and projects linked to the Fund that have been implemented and suspended; (iii) data on the deforestation process observed in the Amazon region between 2013 and 2020; and (iv) contracts signed with international donors (Germany and Norway).\r\n\r\nThe Public Attorney’s Office (Advocacia-Geral da União, AGU), in the defense of the Federal Government, presented a response stating that the ADI-O would not be a suitable instrument “for demonstrating discontent or disagreement with the content of government actions”.\r\n\r\nOn June 26, 2020, the National Development Bank (BNDES), which manages the Amazon Fund, sent information about the resources and projects linked to it. Several NGOs were admitted as amicus curiae by Minister Rosa Weber. On October 23, 2020, Minister Rosa Weber held a public hearing to specify the arguments that underlie ADO 59, in addition to discussing the factual, statistical and normative contexts that permeate the protection and preservation of the Legal Amazon, through the Fund Amazon.\r\n\r\nOn March 18, 2022, the minister and president of the STF, Luiz Fux, admitted seven environmental cases on the agenda for March 30, 2022 (including two climate cases, this case and <a href=\"https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/brazilian-socialist-party-and-others-v-brazil/\">ADPF760</a>). This move by the STF is considered  historical, and was called the \"green agenda.\" On November 3, 2022, the STF determined that the federal government shall, within 60 days, adopt all of the administrative tasks necessary to reactivate the Amazon Fund. The court decided that the decrees that altered the functioning of the Fund and interrupted the funding of new projects were unconstitutional. The court further found that the unilateral extinction of the committee without creating a substituting body was an omission in the government's duty to protect the Amazon rainforest. \r\n\r\nOn August 16, 2023, the Brazilian Supreme Court published the ruling of the case, partially granting the claim. As states, the court, by a majority, following the vote of Reporting Justice Rosa Weber, ordered the Federal Government to take measures to reactivate the Amazon Fund, within sixty days, and to refrain from engaging in omissive conduct that would paralyze the Fund's operation. The decrees that altered the Fund's governance and prevented the financing of new projects were declared unconstitutional, and the previous model is to be resumed. The paralysis of the Amazon Fund was considered an unconstitutional omission by the federal government and an offense to the principle of non-regression. The ruling emphasized that environmental preservation, especially in the Amazon, is an obligation imposed by the Federal Constitution and various international regulations to which the government is legally bound, reducing the space for administrative discretion. It was stated that there is an unconstitutional state of affairs in the Legal Amazon and a destructive and unstructured regulatory state in environmental matters in the region.",

The petitioners rely on the obligation of the Union, the States, the Federal District and the Municipalities to “protect the environment and fight pollution in any of its forms” and “to preserve forests, fauna and flora” per the Federal Constitution, as well as the precautionary principle. The plaintiffs also allege a violation of Article 225 of the Federal Constitution, regarding the State's duties to: preserve and restore ecological processes; promote the ecological management of ecosystems; define territorial spaces and its components to be specially protected; and protect fauna and flora.

On February 2, 2021, the Court ordered the Federal Government and the Economic and Social Development Bank (BNDS) to be summoned to submit information on the resources allocated to the Climate Fund and on the total amount spent on projects and financing linked to the Climate Fund.\r\n\r\nOn May 3, 2021, the Supreme Court denied the preliminary injunction requested by the Brazilian Socialist Party, on the grounds that the request for suspension of funding for the Lixo Zero project by the Union was based on generic irregularities that did not allow confirmation of the concrete veracity of the situation.\r\n\r\nOn June 30, 2022, the Supreme Court rejected the government’s arguments and ruled that the executive branch cannot ignore the mandate of the legislative branch. Instead, the executive branch has a constitutional duty to execute and allocate the funds of the Climate Fund to mitigate climate change, based on both the separation of powers and the constitutional right to a healthy environment. The court further found that the judiciary, in turn, must act to avoid the regression of environmental protection. The Supreme Court clarified that environmental law treaties constitute a particular type of human rights treaty, which enjoy “supranational” status. This “supralegality” of human rights treaties means that they are above “regular” laws in the legal hierarchy. Accordingly, any Brazilian law or decree that contradicts the Paris Agreement, including the nationally determined contribution, may be invalidated. Any action or omission contrary to this protection is a direct violation of the Constitution and human rights. The constitutional duty to allocate the funds effectively means that there is a duty to mitigate climate change considering the international commitments under the climate change framework. ",

      "summary": "In February 2020, a group of German youth filed a legal challenge to Germany's Federal Climate Protection Act (“Bundesklimaschutzgesetz” or “KSG”) in the Federal Constitutional Court, arguing that the KSG's target of reducing GHGs by 55% until 2030 from 1990 levels was insufficient. The complainants alleged that the KSG therefore violated their human rights as protected by the Basic Law, Germany's constitution.\r\n\r\nThe complainants alleged that the KSG's 2030 target did not take into account Germany's and the EU's obligation under the Paris Agreement to limit global temperature rise to \"well below 2 degrees Celsius.\" The complainants argued that in order to \"do its part\" to achieve the Paris Agreement targets, Germany would need to reduce GHGs by 70% from 1990 levels by 2030. Their claims mainly arose out of alleged violations of the fundamental right to a future consistent with human dignity enshrined in Article 1 (1), and the fundamental right to life and physical integrity enshrined in Article 2 (2) of the Basic Law, both in conjunction with Article 20a of the Basic Law, which binds the political process to protect the natural foundations of life in responsibility for future generations. Complainants argued that by requiring insufficient short and medium term GHG reductions and allowing for the transfer of emission allocations between Germany and other EU Member States, despite the inadequacy of the overall EU emissions reduction target, the KSG allowed for climate impacts that violate their fundamental rights.\r\n\r\nThe complainants asked the Federal Constitutional Court to declare that the German legislature violated the Basic Law by only requiring a 55% reduction in GHGs from 1990 levels by 2030 and to declare that the legislature was required to issue new reduction quotas to ensure that Germany's emissions are kept as low as possible, taking into account the principle of proportionality.\r\n\r\nThree other groups of claimants filed simultaneous constitutional complaints targeting the government’s climate protection measures: (i) BUND (Friends of the Earth Germany) and the Association of Solar Supporters and Others in November 2018; (ii) Yi Yi Prue and other individuals from Bangladesh and Nepal in January 2020; (iii) Steinmetz and other individual German youths in January 2020. The Constitutional Court decided jointly on these complaints. \r\n\r\nOn April 29, 2021, the Federal Constitutional Court published its decision striking down parts of the KSG as incompatible with fundamental rights for failing to set sufficient provisions for emission cuts beyond 2030. The Court found that Article 20a of the Basic Law not only obliges the legislature to protect the climate and aim towards achieving climate neutrality, but “also concerns how environmental burdens are spread out between different generations”. For the first time in its jurisprudence, the Court stated that “the fundamental rights - as intertemporal guarantees of freedom - afford protection against the greenhouse gas reduction burdens imposed by Art. 20a of the Basic Law being unilaterally offloaded onto the future”. It further stated that the KSG’s emission provisions in question constituted an “advance interference-like effect”, which possibly violates the complainants’ fundamental rights and thus renders the complaints admissible.\r\n\r\nAccepting arguments that the legislature must follow a carbon budget approach to limit warming to well below 2°C and, if possible, to 1.5°C, the Court found that legislature had not proportionally distributed the budget between current and future generations, writing \"one generation must not be allowed to consume large portions of the CO2 budget while bearing a relatively minor share of the reduction effort, if this would involve leaving subsequent generations with a drastic reduction burden and expose their lives to serious losses of freedom”. The Court also noted that the fact that “no state can resolve the problems of climate change on its own (…) does not invalidate the national obligation to take climate action.” \r\n\r\nThe Court ordered the legislature to set clear provisions for reduction targets from 2031 onward by the end of 2022. In response to the decision, the federal lawmakers passed a bill approving an adapted KSG that requires, at a minimum, reduction of 65% in GHGs from 1990 levels by 2030. It has been in effect since August 31, 2021.",

DUH asked the court to oblige the Authority to review the permit in the context of related (direct and indirect) methane emissions, arguing that a significant upward revision of estimated methane emissions from gas production and transportation has occurred since the permit was first granted in January 2018. Alternatively, DUH requested that the court suspend the permit and refer the case to the European Court of Justice for a preliminary ruling regarding compliance with the European precautionary principle.\r\n\r\nOn November 16, 2021, the court ruled the DUH complaint against the Stralsund Mining Authority partly inadmissible, partly unsubstantiated.

In the preliminary stages, the plant, which had not yet started operating, had already been tested for gas tightness in accordance with the technical safety regulations. With regard to the associated Russian gas infrastructure on land, the court found the complaint admissible but unfounded.

The ACF appealed the decision dismissing the judicial review challenge. Adani proposed to develop and operate a coal mine and associated infrastructure in Central Queensland. The ACF alleged error by the Minister in failing to determine the impact of combustion emissions on the Great Barrier Reef under s 527E of the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. The Minister had approved the coal mine project on October 14, 2015. \r\nThe Act requires consideration of the proposal in connection with, among other things, its effects upon the environment. There is a prohibition upon the taking of action that has, will have, or is likely to have a significant impact on the environment. The ACF claimed that the Minister made an error of law in failing to consider the effect of emissions from transport by rail, shipping, and combustion of the product coal overseas, in characterising these emissions as “not a direct consequence of the proposed action,” and in failing to consider or apply the precautionary principle in relation to the possible impacts on relevant matters of national environmental significance. The court upheld the lower court’s findings that the Minister’s reasons reflected a proper discharge of his statutory duty in a judgement issued on August 25, 2017.\r\n\r\nHowever, in a judgement issued December 15, 2017, the Court accepted that matters concerning the Reef and climate change were important to Australians.

The protesters blocked a railway line that provides access to a coal loading facility by using tubular steel attachment devices to \"lock\" themselves to a 44 gallon drum filled with concrete, creating a device known as a \"dragon's den.\" The devices can only be released voluntarily, or if someone else cuts the device, and cutting the device risks injury to the protesters. The defendants were charged with obstructing a railway; trespassing on a railway; using a dangerous attachment device to interfere with transport infrastructure; and contravening a direction or requirement. The dangerous attachment device offense was a new offense created by 2019 legislation that prohibits the use of devices such as \"dragon dens,\" which was introduced in response to protests against coal mining and regarding climate change. The Acting Magistrate convicted and sentenced the defendants to three months imprisonment for that offense. Convictions were not recorded for the other offenses. \r\n\r\nOn appeal, the district court concluded that the device the protesters used fell within the definition of a \"dragon's den,\" but that the gravity of the offense was minimal given the lack of evidence that any loss was suffered, that members of the public were burdened, or that there was violence or the threat of violence. The court further explained that the defendants \"have the right to express their views and to protest against an activity to which they object subject only to such restrictions as are prescribed by law and are necessary in a democratic society for (amongst other legitimate aims) the prevention of disorder or crime or the protection of the rights and freedoms of others,\" and that \"the motive for the commission of the offen[s]e will often be relevant to the moral culpability of the offender, the weight to given to personal deterrence and it may affect the weight to be given to general deterrence.\" The court accordingly allowed the appeal, vacated the convictions and resentenced the defendants to a single fine of $1000.

      "summary": "On September 8, 2020, eight young people filed a putative class action in Australia's Federal Court to block a coal project. The lawsuit sought an injunction to stop the Australian Government from approving an extension of the Whitehaven Vickery coal mine. The plaintiffs claimed to represent all people under 18, and argued that Federal Minister Sussan Ley has a common law duty of care for young people. They further asserted that digging up and burning coal will exacerbate climate change and harm young people in the future. Plaintiffs sought an injunction to prevent the Minister from approving the project under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act (EPBC). \r\n\r\nOn May 27, 2021, the Federal Court of Australia established a new duty of care to avoid causing personal harm to children but declined to issue an injunction to force the Minister to block the coal mine extension. The Court concluded that \"the applicants have established that the Minister has a duty to take reasonable care to avoid causing personal injury to the Children when deciding, under s 130 and s 133 of the EPBC Act, to approve or not approve the Extension Project.\" In establishing the duty of care, the Court found that the foreseeable harm from the project, if the risks were to come true, would be \"catastrophic\", and therefore children should be considered persons who would be so directly affected that the Minister ought to consider their interests when making the approval decision. In declining to issue an injunction, the Court found that the plaintiffs had not established that it is probable that the Minister would breach the duty of care in making the approval decision, and had not established that they will have no further opportunity to apply for an injunction. In its May 27, 2021 judgment, the Court delayed issuing a declaration about the duty of care owed by the minister, and raised a number of questions to the parties about the scope of the duty.\r\n\r\nOn July 8, 2021, the Court issued a declaration that \"The [Minister] has a duty to take reasonable care . . . to avoid causing personal injury or death to persons who were under 18 years of age and ordinarily resident in Australia at the time of the commencement of this proceeding arising from emissions of carbon dioxide into the Earth’s atmosphere.\" In issuing the declaration, the Court rejected arguments by the Minister to limit the declaration to only the applicants. Instead, the Court declared the duty applied to all Australian young people because both the applicants and Australian young people had the \"same interest.\" The Court ordered the Minister to pay costs. \r\n\r\nOn September 13, 2021, the Ministry of Environment filled an appeal questioning the judge’s finding that the Minister owes a duty of care to avoid causing personal injury to children related to anthropogenic climate change. The appeal is based on the separation of powers and the argument that the Minister’s decision is a matter of policy and subject to discretion. The regulation of GHG emissions is better suited for the Executive, and no novel duty of care should be recognized. The appeal also questioned whether the approved project would cause a net increase in global GHG emissions and the reversed onus of proof in approaching this issue. \r\n\r\nDespite the Federal Court’s decision, on September 15, 2021, the Minister granted approval for the proposed mine expansion. A hearing was held on October 18-20, 2021. On March 15, 2022, the Full Federal Court of Australia unanimously overturned the primary judge’s decision to impose a duty of care on the Minister. The three judges had separate reasonings. Chief Justice Allsop found that the duty would require consideration of questions of policy “unsuitable for the judicial branch to resolve.” Justice Beach found insufficient “closeness” between the Minister and the children but left open the possibility of a future claim if any of the children suffered damage. Justice Wheelahan found that (i) the EPBC Act cannot establish a duty of care relationship between the Minister and children, (ii) establishing a duty would be incoherent with the Minister’s functions under the EPBC Act and (iii) it was not foreseeable that approval of the coal mine extension would cause personal injury to the children. Despite allowing the Minister’s appeal, the Court rejected the Minister’s argument that the primary judge made findings based on evidence of climate change that were unfounded. This means that the primary judge's findings of fact about the risk of harm of climate change to children remain. The Full Federal Court noted that “the nature of the risks and the dangers from global warming, including the possible catastrophe that may engulf the world and humanity” were never in dispute. \r\n\r\nThe plaintiffs announced that they would not appeal the decision. \r\n\r\nThe plaintiffs asked the court to make orders that the proceeding not continue as a representative proceeding. \r\n\r\nThe Full Court was of the view that before orders were made setting aside the orders of the Court\r\nmade by the primary judge and dismissing the amended originating application dated 14\r\nDecember 2020, the parties should be afforded an opportunity to consider whether any further\r\norders were appropriate or necessary to address the representative nature of the proceeding. This is because the proceedings in their current form would bind the represented children (all Australians under the age of 18 at the time the case was filed), and give rise to an issue estoppel in relation to all questions of fact and law necessary to the Full Court’s conclusion that the Minister did not owe the posited duty of care. This would prevent the represented children from bringing proceedings of a similar nature in the future. \r\n\r\nAccordingly, the parties asked the court to make orders that the proceeding not continue as a representative proceeding. The relevant orders were made by the court on 14 April 2022 and reasons published on 22 April 2022. \r\n",

The Court noted there was evidence of cumulative effects of clearing and logging activities, current burning regimes, and climate change impacts being major threats to large hollow-bearing trees. These trees at issue were relied upon by the species. \r\n\r\nIn a decision issued on May 10, 2018, the Court restrained VicForests from conducting forestry operations. The respondent was restrained from felling, removing, or damaging any trees or otherwise widening the existing road line. Much of the evidence submitted was taken for the limited purpose of the interlocutory application and was probative and untested.\r\n",

Further, subdividing the property was not shown to improve farm economics and viability, and would actually potentially stifle production innovation. \r\n",

The Department and Pittwater Council conducted a Warriewood Valley Strategic Review Report in reviewing the land, which included a hydrology study. The hydrology study categorized land into categories based on the flood planning level. This study considered the impacts of climate change on the flood planning.

      "count": 1,
      "summary": "On September 15, 2020, Greenpeace Spain, Oxfam Intermón, and Ecologistas en Acción filed a motion notifying the Supreme Court of their intention to sue the Spanish Government, alleging failure to take adequate action on climate change. The plaintiffs assert that Spain is in violation of Regulation (EU) 2018/1999 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 December 2018 on the Governance of the Energy Union and Climate Action. According to plaintiffs, by December 2019, Spain should have approved a National Energy and Climate Plan with climate goals for 2030 and a Long Term Strategy with goals for 2050; and the draft plan is not consistent with the Paris Agreement and IPCC recommendations to keep global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. The complaint seeks an order compelling greater climate action. \r\n\r\nOn September 30, 2020, the Supreme Court admitted the statement of claim and required the Ministry of the Presidency to present its administrative file within 20 days. After the government presented its file, plaintiffs filed an application for the Court to order an expanded file on the argument that the file the government presented was incomplete. The Court rejected this application, and Plaintiffs appealed. \r\n\r\nIn the meantime, on November 3, 2020, Spain's Council of Ministers approved a Long Term Decarbonization Strategy for 2050. Then, on November 26, 2020, the State Attorney filed a motion to dismiss the plaintiff's claims with regard to the Long Term Strategy, and plaintiffs filed a motion on December 15, 2020 agreeing with the dismissal of that claim but retaining their suit challenging the lack of a 2030 plan. \r\n\r\nOn December 15, 2020, plaintiffs filed their lawsuit in the Supreme Court, alleging that Spain unlawfully failed to produce a National Energy and Climate Plan with 2030 climate targets, in violation of national law, EU regulations, and their obligations under the Paris Agreement. \r\n\r\nThe government filed their response on March 2, 2021. Two weeks later, the Supreme Court issued a decision rejecting all of the plaintiffs' witnesses as irrelevant to the trial, and the plaintiffs appealed this decision.\r\n\r\nAlso in March 2021, the government approved the National Energy and Climate Plan. The defendants then filed a brief requesting dismissal of the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The plaintiffs filed their response on May 26, 2021. In the meantime, the plaintiffs filed additional case challenging the National Energy and Climate Plan. \r\n\r\nOn June 14, 2021, the Supreme Court rejected the defendants' motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The Court found that the approval of the National Energy and Climate Plan did not exhaust plaintiffs' claims because their claims were broader than simply seeking the passage of the Plan. Instead, they sought an order that the Plan must be more ambitious to be aligned with the objectives of the Paris Agreement. On June 30, 2021, the government appealed. On July 9, 2021, the plaintiffs responded to the appeal. \r\n\r\nOn September 14, 2021, the Supreme Court rejected the State's appeal to dismiss the case. The Supreme Court found that the inactivity of the Spanish government can still be observed, since the government has not fully complied with the content of the Paris Agreement.\r\n\r\nOn March 7, 2022, the Supreme Court issued a ruling (not publicly available) which stated that the case was ready for deliberation. Greenpeace appealed the ruling based on formal considerations. The appeal particularly focused on a request that Greenpeace vs. Spain II be jointly considered and judged, given the close connection between the matters under both of them. On March 31, 2022, the Supreme Court rejected Greenpeace's arguments and confirmed the earlier ruling. The case is pending final decision.\r\n\r\nOn 20 June 2023, the Supreme Court issued its final decision on Greenpeace v. Spain, known as the trial for climate (“el juicio por el clima”). The decision was notified to the parties on 27 July and, although still pending publication, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the Government of Spain and against the environmental and human rights organizations such as Greenpeace and Oxfam who sued the Government of Spain alleging failure to take adequate action on climate change. Particularly, the plaintiffs alleged that the National Energy and Climate Plan 2021-2030  (PNIEC) approved by the Government of Spain was not ambitious enough to meet the Paris Agreement's temperature goals.  Spain’s Energy and Climate Plan 2021-2030 is the main Spanish instrument that defines the goals for GHG emissions reduction, sets out the objectives for renewable energy and those of energy efficiency for the period 2021-2030.\r\n\r\nThe plaintiffs requested the Supreme Court that the PNIEC was declared partially null, as the objectives laid out not to exceed 1.5º C were not ambitious enough, as the GHG emissions reduction should at least be 55% in 2030, compared to 1990, and the organizations found that the 23% reduction set out in the PNIEC was not adequate. Alternatively, the plaintiffs requested the Supreme Court that the PNIEC was wholly declared null. \r\n\r\nNotwithstanding, the Supreme Court decision argues that the Government of Spain has acted in accordance with the Paris Agreement and cannot be held accountable for non-compliance, as it has joined the Paris Agreement through the European Union, and has passed national legislation in accordance with the commitments adopted at EU level. \r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court points out that although the Paris Agreement and the subsequent EU commitments and regulations adopted constitute the minimum limit for Member States to adopt their own regulations, it cannot be concluded that the Spanish Government has failed to adopt regulation, when the regulation passed is aligned with the EU commitments to which the Spanish State is adhered such as the Paris Agreement. \r\n\r\nMoreover, the Supreme Court argues that the objectives laid down in the PNIEC cannot be deemed as arbitrarily, but on the contrary, as they are aligned with the EU regulations and follow EU's criteria for PNIECs. The Court goes beyond to state that, in declaring the PNIEC null, and even noting that the Paris Agreement and EU regulations allow Member States to set out more ambitious objectives, if the Court declared the PNIEC null it could be in violation of the scope of their jurisdiction, as the PNIEC was adopted and negotiated harmoniously within the EU.\r\n\r\nAll documents below are in Spanish.

On September 4, 2015, Mitchell Lark appealed a denial of his application to modify those conditions to the New South Wales Land and Environment Court.

The Court reasoned that the site was on flood prone land in a Medium Flood Risk Precinct, and that the Council would likely not have approved the development application had the floor levels as-built been proposed.

When the authorities failed to respond, Shrestha petitioned the Supreme Court of Nepal to issue a writ of mandamus or other appropriate order to enact such a law. According to the petition, the Environmental Protection Act of 1997 was inadequate because it did not address climate change, the Climate Change Policy of 2011 had not been implemented, and as a result, the humans and ecosystems of Nepal had experienced grave climate impacts. Shrestha alleged that the government’s failure to adequately address climate had violated the rights to a dignified life and a healthy environment guaranteed in the Constitution of Nepal, and violated Nepal’s commitments under the UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement. The existential threat created by climate change impaired his constitutional rights to (i) live with dignity, (ii) live in a healthy and clean environment, (iii) access basic healthcare services, and (iv) food and protection from starvation. The petitioner further argued that a specific climate change law was needed as the Environment Protection Act made no provision for climate change mitigation and adaptation. He contended that the gap must be rectified immediately. \r\n\r\nIn a decision issued on December 25, 2018, the Supreme Court found that action was needed to ensure climate justice, sustainable development, and intragenerational and intergenerational justice. Nepal’s commitments under multilateral climate change treaties and the operation of the 2015 constitution required action. Article 51(g) of the Constitution of Nepal obligated the government to protect the environment. The court concluded that climate change impaired the petitioner’s constitutional right to a dignified life and a clean and healthy environment. \r\nThe Court ordered the government of Nepal to enact a new climate change law to (i) mitigate and adapt to the effects of climate change, (ii) reduce the consumption of fossil fuels and promote low carbon technologies, and (iii) develop scientific and legal instruments to compensate those harmed by pollution and environmental degradation, among other provisions. The Court issued a writ of mandamus and ordered the government to pass and implement a new climate law to effectuate Nepal’s commitments under the Paris Agreement and obligations under the Constitution. The Court further reasoned that the Environmental Protection Act of 1997 was inadequate to address needed climate change mitigation and adaptation, and ordered the government to implement existing national climate policy until the new law would be enacted. Further, pending passage of the climate change law, the court directed the government to implement its climate change policy, National Adaptation Programme of Action 2010, and National Framework on Local Adaptation Plans for Action 2011.\r\n\r\nSubsequent to the Supreme Court decision, the government of Nepal passed the Environment Protection Act of 2019 and the Forests Act of 2019.

The complaint asserts that the Program infringes upon human rights, including the right to a healthy environment and access to electricity from renewable sources. This infringement stems from the Program's promotion of fossil fuel usage at the expense of investments in renewable energy, greenhouse gas reduction, and climate adaptation.\r\n\r\nSubsequently, on September 21, 2020, the Court issued a preliminary injunction, temporarily suspending the Program while the case was pending resolution. This suspension was predicated on the Program's prioritization of fossil fuels, which could potentially pose imminent, irreparable harm.\r\n\r\nOn February 22, 2021, Greenpeace expanded its complaint to encompass the Federal Expenditure Budget for the Federation for the fiscal year 2021, specifically annexes 15 and 16. Annex 15 pertains to the budget allocation for the energy transition strategy, which promotes renewable technologies, while Annex 16 concerns resources assigned for climate change adaptation and mitigation.

      "summary": "On November 11, 2020, seven political parties in Brazil (Partido Socialista Brasileiro (PSB) and six others) brought an action against the federal government for violating fundamental constitutional rights by failing to implement the national deforestation policy, and thereby contributing to dangerous climate change. The political parties, organized by a coalition of nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), allege that by failing to implement Brazil's Action Plan for Prevention and Control of the Legal Amazon Deforestation (PPCDAm), the federal government violated the fundamental rights of indigenous peoples and present and future generations. \r\n\r\nThe suit demands that the federal government and its bodies implement the PPCDAm and suggests the Court set benchmarks for compliance including: (i) meet an 80% deforestation rate reduction relative to the 1996-2005 average by 2021, (ii) enact a temporary moratorium on all deforestation until 2022 if that rate cannot be reached by 2021, and (iii) increase the power of federal authorities to set penalties for illegal deforestation. \r\n\r\nThe coalition of NGOs organized the lawsuit and compiled evidence of the government's suspended enforcement of the PPDCAm. According to the NGOs, Brazil saw a 34% increase in the Amazon deforestation rate between 2018 and 2019. Due to procedural requirements for such an action alleging the violation of a fundamental constitutional right, heard directly at the Federal Supreme Court (STF), the NGOs organized seven political parties to bring the case. \r\n\r\nOn November 24, 2020, the STF's Minister Carmém Lúcia received the complaint and granted several request from NGOs for admission as amicus curiae. Subsequently, the Attorney General's Office requested the rejection of the claim. On September 20, 2021, the Attorney General argued that an Action for Noncompliance with a Fundamental Precept (ADPF) cannot impose on the Executive Branch how to manage illegal deforestation in the Amazon Forest. In addition, the Attorney General argued that both the Presidency and the Ministry of the Environment are taking the appropriate measures  to preserve the Amazon. As such, the requests are incompatible and must be considered unfounded by the court.\r\n\r\nOn March 18, 2022, the minister and president of the STF, Luiz Fux, admitted seven environmental cases on the agenda for March 30, 2022 (including two climate cases, this case and <a href=\"https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/psb-et-al-v-brazil/\">ADO59</a>). This move by the STF is considered  historical, and was called the \"green agenda.\"\r\n\r\nDue to the similarity of the objects of this ADO (54) and ADPF 760, the Rapporteur of both, Minister Carmen Lúcia, decided to judge them together. In a plenary session, the Justice acknowledged and upheld the actions. In her vote, the Justice stated that the right to an ecologically balanced environment is a fundamental right provided for in the Constitution and in international treaties to which Brazil is a party. The Minister emphasized the principle of the prohibition of environmental retrogression and considered that there was a process of normative \"termite infestation\" taking place silently, through the dismantling of the state's bureaucratic-normative apparatus. This phenomenon is only visible with a general analysis of the existing framework in the country. It recognized the unconstitutional state of affairs regarding the illegal deforestation of the Amazon rainforest. It ordered the resumption of the Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of Deforestation in the Legal Amazon (PPCDAm) by the Federal Union and the competent federal bodies. After the Reporting Justice's vote, Justice André Mendonça asked to see the case file and so the judgment was suspended.\r\n\r\nOn April 6, 2022, following Supreme Federal Court (STF) minister Cármen Lúcia´s decision that the Federal Government should resume the PPCDAm (Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of Deforestation in the Amazon Region) within the framework of ADPF 760, Minister André Mendonça requested further information, effectively putting the brakes on the ruling. In addition to determining that the Federal Government should set out a plan to combat deforestation following the guidelines of the PPCDAm (Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of Deforestation in the Amazon Region) within the next 60 days, the Minister-Rapporteur also took the stance that in the ruling of ADPF 760 and <a href=\"https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/ado-54-amazon-deforestation/\">ADO54</a>), the STF should collaborate in strengthening government organs linked to the social-environmental agenda, like Funai (National Indian Foundation), Ibama (Brazilian Institute for the Environment and Renewable Natural Resources) and ICMBio (the Chico Mendes Institute of Conservation of Biodiversity), given the shortcomings that exist at the government level. She went on to acknowledge the “situation of unconstitutional aspects regarding illegal deforestation in the Amazon Rainforest and the failure of the Brazilian state concerning the role of protecting an ecologically balanced environment”. The minister further stated that “the right to an ecologically balanced environment is one of the human rights included in agreements that Brazil has committed to”, not only in the Constitution but also in international pacts.\r\n\r\nOn April 3rd, 2024, ADPF 760 and ADO 54 were partially upheld. The Court did not declare the state of affairs unconstitutional but recognized the existence of structural flaws in the policy of protecting the Legal Amazon. It ordered the Federal Government to make a \"significant commitment\" to combating illegal deforestation in the biome and determined that it should adopt measures to implement the PPCDAm, strengthen the inspection bodies IBAMA, ICMBio, and Funai and the Federal Government should present transparent information on the actions and results of the measures adopted in compliance with the STF's orders and that the data on the measures adopted by the Executive Branch should be submitted to the CNJ's Observatory on the Environment and Climate Change in the Judicial Branch.\r\n\r\nThe judgment was published on June 26, 2024, and the case is in the process of compliance with the decision.",

      "summary": "On October 8, 2020, the Institute of Amazonian Studies (Instituto de Estudos Amazônicos - IEA) filed a Public Civil Action (class action) against the Federal Government of Brazil, seeking recognition of a fundamental right to a stable climate for present and future generations under the Brazilian Constitution, and seeking an order to compel the federal government to comply with national climate law. Plaintiffs allege that the federal government has failed to comply with its own action plans to prevent deforestation and mitigate and adapt to climate change, violating national law and fundamental rights. Plaintiffs assert that the government has failed to meet the Brazilian emissions targets set out in the Climate Change National Policy Act, a binding act passed by the Brazilian legislature. In order to meet these targets, the federal government issued a decree setting out specific action plans for preventing and controlling deforestation in various Brazilian biomes, as well as outlining sectoral plans for climate change mitigation and adaptation. A key part of this decree is the Action Plan for Prevention and Control of Deforestation in Legal Amazon (PPCDAm). By failing to meet critical targets in the PPCDAm and emissions targets, plaintiffs allege that the government is violating fundamental rights and national law. Plaintiffs seek an order to compel the federal government to comply with its existing policies, to reforest an area equivalent to what was deforested beyond the statutory limit, and to allocate sufficient budgetary resources for this purpose.\r\n\r\nIn July 2021, the Federal District Court of Curitiba issued an order rejecting jurisdiction and transferring the case to the 7th Federal Environmental and Agrarian Court of the Judiciary Section of Amazonas, on account of the alleged connection between this case and another case in that court. The other case involves a dispute over whether the government adequately implemented measures to combat those who put the Amazon forest and its ecological hotspots under threat during the Covid-19 pandemic. The lower court found that both lawsuits aimed at combating illegal deforestation in the Amazon and both referred to the PPCDAm, thus presenting “sufficient similarity” or “close connection” between the issues discussed, thereby “giving rise to an undue risk of conflicting solutions.” IEA appealed the transfer decision to the federal appellate court (TRF4). \r\n\r\nOn August 20, 2021, the TRF4 (through a decision from the reporting judge) suspended the lower court decision to transfer the case and returned the case to the Federal District Court of Curitiba. The Court found that this case and the ecological hotspots case \"present quite different typology and structure, specialized instruments and distinct political-legal approaches, in addition to the fact that their object, cause of action and demands do not coincide.\" The Court found that this case has as its central objective to put pressure on the legislative and executive branches to ensure a stable climate. The ecological hotspots case, on the other hand, addresses matters related to environmental law, and does not have a central theme linked to Brazilian climate legislation. The decision also includes a lengthy discussion of the unique nature and importance of climate litigation. On December 7, 2021, the third chamber of the appellate court confirmed the decision. \r\n\r\nOn March 29, 2022, the TRF4 issued a decision delimiting the powers of the amicus curiae, given their inability to appeal the decisions of the process. The judge considered the request for the National Institute for Space Research (INPE) to act as amicus curiae in the case to be unfounded, given that the entity did not show interest. Furthermore, the decision called for a conciliation hearing and judgment of the case to be scheduled within 30 days and for the parties, the Attorney General's Office and the Federal Public Ministry to be summoned regarding the date and time of the hearing. It is worth mentioning that the order also deals with the possibility of the parties being accompanied by technicians in order to clarify any points on the subject. Two days after the dispatch of the order, the parties were summoned and the hearing was scheduled for May 18, 2022 in the courtroom of the 11th Federal Court.\r\n\r\nOn July 22, 2022, the Federal Government filed its defense, pointing out that the Federal Government has adopted active measures for the formulation, implementation and management of public environmental protection policies. It denied that the Federal Government, the MMA, and other federal entities had failed to implement public policies to combat deforestation in the Amazon and to meet internationally agreed climate targets. It emphasized that investment in protecting and inspecting indigenous lands has increased, even during the COVID-19 pandemic. It denied that the country is failing to comply with international agreements and that the Federal Government is failing to comply with policies aimed at controlling illegal deforestation in the Amazon rainforest, nor that an unconstitutional environmental state of affairs has been established. It emphasized that the responsibility for recovering deforested areas should be attributed to those responsible for such acts, not the Federal Government. It argued that there was no causal link between the federal government and the environmental damage mentioned in the initial petition. Finally, required that the claims should be dismissed. \r\n\r\nIn October 2022, the Institute for Amazonian Studies filed a request for urgent injunctive relief because it was necessary for the Federal Government to be urgently compelled to carry out direct and effective actions to start forest restoration processes in the Legal Amazon, with the aim of reducing the damage caused to the climate system. IEA emphasized that the measures adopted so far by the federal government have been innocuous in the face of growing deforestation, and that the federal government has continually failed to comply with its climate obligations. It requested that the Federal Government be granted a preliminary injunction ordering it to: (i) carry out forest restoration work in the Legal Amazon; (ii) begin reforesting the region within one year; (ii) restore illegally deforested areas above the legal permissive established in the PNMC and considering the PRODES 2020 and PRODES 2021 data; (iv) maintain forest restoration activities until the deforestation rate reaches a level of 3,925.06 km2. 925.06 km2; (v) the allocation of budgetary, technical and personnel resources for these purposes; (vi) the payment of a daily fine in the event of non-compliance with the measures; (vii) the determination that the measurement of the rate of deforestation in the Legal Amazon should use the official data provided by the PRODES system. Afterwards, the Institute filed a petition requesting that the request for injunctive relief be added, asking that the area of forest in the Legal Amazon that had been deforested above the maximum legal rate allowed by the PPCDAm be restored and presenting new arguments that indicate the upward trend in deforestation in the Amazon biome.\r\n\r\nIn November 2024, the court rejected the request for interim relief, but acknowledged that the plaintiff's arguments were credible, but that procedural issues were pending and required the parties and the MPF to comment on them in order for the relief to be granted. It also recognized that climate change affects humanity as a whole and the important role of the Amazon rainforest in this context. It ordered the reversal of the burden of proof, so that the Federal Government must prove compliance with the PPCDAm in terms of repairing environmental damage. In addition, it ruled that there was partial lis pendens between this action and ADPF 760 and ADO 54 and ordered that the proceedings be suspended for up to a year in order to await the progress of compliance with the judgments handed down in the aforementioned actions.\r\n\r\nThe IEA filed an interlocutory appeal challenging the decision that rejected the request for injunctive relief and ordered that the case be suspended for one year. The decision, however, was upheld because it was necessary to await the outcome of the proceedings ordered by the STF, in order to avoid overlapping proceedings for the same purpose.",

      "summary": "On June 1, 2020, Transport Action Network (TAN) filed a suit in the High Court of Justice challenging the legality of the UK government's Second Roads Investment Strategy, covering the years 2020-2025, on climate and air pollution grounds. TAN, an environmental advocacy NGO, named the Secretary of State for Transport as the defendant and Highways England Company, appointed by the Secretary to implement the strategy, as an interested party. TAN listed four grounds for its suit: 1) the Secretary failed to take into account the impact of the roads strategy on achieving climate objectives, in violation of the Infrastructure Act of 2015 and the objectives of the Paris Agreement; 2) the Secretary unlawfully failed to establish a metric for measuring GHG emissions; 3) the Secretary unlawfully failed to ensure levels of air pollutants do not exceed limits set in air quality regulations; and 4) the Secretary unlawfully failed to carry out a Strategic Environmental Assessment of the roads strategy. \r\n\r\nOn July 21, 2020, the High Court admitted the case on the first ground - that the Secretary unlawfully failed to take into account climate impacts. On October 19, 2020, TAN renewed its application for the court to admit the air pollution claims, and a hearing was held on the issue on October 29, 2020. \r\n\r\nOn July 26, 2021, the High Court dismissed the case. The Court found that the Secretary of State for Transport, in approving the strategy, had given adequate regard to UK Policy on Climate Change. The Court upheld the Department of Transport's determination that the greenhouse gas emissions associated with the RIS were de minimis and not obviously material to the decision-making process. In the course of the judgment the Court also observed that \"there is nothing in the IA 2015 [Infrastructure Act 2015] which remotely resembles environmental decision-making.\"",

      "summary": "In 2020, a series of three linked legal challenges were brought by environmental NGO Transport Action Network (“TAN”) related to UK's road building policies. TAN argued the UK government acted unlawfully by not suspending and reviewing its ‘National Policy Statement on National Networks’, given what TAN claimed were significant changes in climate law and policy since the policy’s designation in 2014. The policy statement sets the strategy for the UK’s road building programme. The government has powers to suspend and review policy statements under the Planning Act 2008, and must take into account certain criteria when doing so.\r\n\r\nTAN began with a series of pre-action letters, available on its website. They included requests to the government to suspend and review the policy statement in light of, amongst other matters, the new statutory target of net zero UK emissions by 2050. In October 2020, the government decided a review was not appropriate. This resulted in TAN’s first claim for judicial review (CO/4575/2020). That claim was then stayed as the government had stated that it would reconsider whether a review was appropriate. \r\n\r\nIn February 2021, the government decided, for a second time, a review was not appropriate. This resulted in TAN’s second claim for judicial review, issued in April 2021 (CO/1482/2021). However, that claim became theoretical when the government made a fresh decision, in July 2021, to conduct a review, partly because of the increased stringency of climate change targets and policy. \r\n\r\nNonetheless, the government declined to exercise its statutory power to suspend the policy statement pending its review.\r\nThis resulted in TAN’s third claim for judicial review, issued in September 2021 (CO/3011/2021), specifically challenging the decision not to suspend the policy statement. The High Court refused permission for that claim to proceed to a full hearing (firstly on the papers, and then following a permission hearing), bringing the legal challenges to an end.",

After the Commission declined to participate in the proceedings, the Bylong Valley Protection Alliance, a community group, successfully intervened and was joined as a second respondent.\r\n\r\nOn December 18, 2020, the Court rejected KEPCO's appeal, upholding the Independent Planning Commission's findings that the mine was contrary to the principles of ecologically sustainable development and would have problematic climate impacts.\r\n\r\nOn March 19, 2021, KEPCO subsequently submitted another appeal to the NSW Court of Appeal.

According to news reports, CCWA alleges that the state EPA had previously only allowed the plants to process gas from particular sources. Then, in July 2019, EPA made two decisions allowing the plants to process gas from any source, made under provisions of the Environmental Protection Act that allows minor changes to previous approvals without significant assessment. CCWA alleges that the environmental and climate impacts were major and should have triggered the full consideration of the EPA.

      "count": 1,
      "summary": "In September 2020, Friends of the Earth England Wales and Northern Ireland brought a legal challenge against UK Export Finance’s decision (the “Decision”) to provide over $1 billion of UK taxpayers’ money to help finance a liquefied natural gas (“LNG”) project off the coast of Mozambique. Through the project, the energy company Total (an interested party) aims to extract 43 million tonnes of LNG per year for 32 years. This will result in total combustion emissions of 4.3 billion tonnes of CO2e: more than the total annual emissions for all 27 countries within the EU.\r\n\r\nThis case is not concerned with whether, or the extent to which, the UK government should have considered the Paris Agreement in reaching its decision. Rather, it is concerned with whether, having concluded that both the project and its financing were compatible with the UK and Mozambique’s obligations under the Agreement, and having taken the decision on that basis, the decision was lawful.\r\nIn March 2022 the High Court issued a judgment with a split two-judge court. One of the judges ruled: (a) the government erred as it had no rational basis to conclude financing the project was consistent with article 2(1)(c) of the Paris Agreement; (b) government ministers approving the deal were misled; and (c) for finance flows to be aligned to the Paris Agreement, they must be demonstrably aligned with the Agreement’s temperature goals. The second judge ruled the decision was lawful. He held the court should give the government latitude in deciding for itself what enquiry to make, for example when quantifying climate impacts, and that the court should only scrutinise the government’s decision lightly. The claim proceeded to the Court of Appeal.\r\n\r\nIn January 2023 the Court of Appeal gave judgment, unanimously dismissing Friends of the Earth’s appeal. The court held:\r\n1) On the standard of review, the government was only required to adopt a ‘tenable’ view of what the Paris Agreement meant. It was not required to adopt a correct view, as Friends of the Earth had argued (relying on the Vienna Convention).\r\n2) In this case the government had adopted a tenable view.\r\n3) It was not irrational to make the decision to fund such a project without quantifying its scope 3 emissions. The project would have gone ahead with or without finance from UK Export Finance, the absolute quantification of scope 3 emissions would not have answered the nuanced question of whether the financing was compatible with the UK’s obligations under the PA, and the obligations in question were not absolute requirements to restrict the increase in global average temperature and to make finance flows consistent with a low-emissions pathway and climate-resilient development, but rather, these were only some of the purposes of the PA.\r\n\r\nThough the court declined to construct the PA’s precise meaning, it held that:\r\n•\tThe actions required by Articles 4, 7, 9, 10, 11 and 13 are not merely aims and aspirations, as one of the lower judges held, but are to be taken with the aim of strengthening the global response to the threat of climate change, in the context of sustainable development and efforts to eradicate poverty and for purposes including achieving the temperature goals and making finance flows consistent with a low-emissions pathway.\r\n•\tThe temperature goal in article 2(1)(a) is a clear objective of the PA, to which all parties committed.\r\n•\tIt was not clear to what extent the project would contribute to the fossil fuel transition, and it was not necessary for the respondents to take any firm view as to the precise nature of the UK’s obligations under the PA, only as to what was not required of the UK, namely that article 2(1)(c) does not create an obligation for the UK to show that its decision on overseas funding is consistent with a low-emissions pathway. Because the respondents were advised that the project could, in some scenarios, align with the UK’s obligations under the PA, the decision was not irrational.\r\n\r\nIn June 2023 the Supreme Court refused Friends of the Earth permission to appeal the Court of Appeal’s decision, bringing the litigation to an end.",

In a notice of possible legal procedure sent to the Dutch government in advance of the suit, plaintiffs cited the European Convention on Human Rights and the Paris Agreement as establishing that duty of care, and the Dutch Supreme Court's Urgenda decision as affirming the duty of care. Plaintiffs alleged that by failing to attach binding climate conditions to the 3.4 billion euro bailout package, the government violated human rights. Greenpeace sought a court order either prohibiting the State from providing financial support or conditioning such support on KLM setting a cap on CO2 emissions by the airline.  \r\n\r\nOn December 9, 2020, the Hague District Court judge rejected Greenpeace's claim on the grounds that the State does not have a legally enforceable obligation to attach climate conditions to the bailout package. The judge reasoned that the executive has a high level of discretion in acting to respond to the coronavirus crisis, and that a judge is limited in such situations to intervening only where a positive legal right has been violated. The judge found no such right here because the Paris Agreement and other international climate treaties do not commit parties to reducing emissions from cross-border aviation. Further, the judge noted that the sustainability conditions that were included in the bailout package were fully in line with the Netherlands' international climate obligations. ",

Environmental NGO ClientEarth submitted a request on August 9, 2018, to the EIB for internal review of that decision. ClientEarth disputed that the project would contribute to renewable energy objectives because, in part, it overestimated environmental advantages associated with biomass and underestimated logging and forest fire emission risks. On October 30, 2018, EIB rejected the request as inadmissible on the grounds that its financing decision was not an \"administrative act\" nor was the decision taken \"under environmental law\" as defined in the Aarhus Convention and therefore was not subject to internal review.\r\n\r\nClientEearth filed suit on January 8, 2019, in the EU General Court against the European Investment Bank (EIB), alleging that the bank had improperly rejected ClientEarth's petition for an internal review of the Bank's decision to finance a biomass power plant. ClientEarth argued that in rejecting its petition for internal review, the EIB misapplied the Aarhus Convention on access to information, public participation in decision-making and access to justice in environmental matters.\r\n\r\nThe EU General Court issued a decision on January 27, 2021, issuing an order that the EIB must accept ClientEarth's petition for internal review. The Court found that the financing decision was taken \"under environmental law\" because all acts of public authorities which may violate environmental law, regardless of whether the institution is formed by environmental law, should be subject to internal review. Here the EIB's decision was based on an assessment of whether it met renewable energy goals and therefore impacted environmental law. Further, the Court found that the decision was an \"administrative act\" despite the terms and conditions of the loan not yet being set because it produced definitive legally binding effects on third parties by enabling others to take steps to formalize the loan.\r\n\r\nOn April 2, 2021, the EIB appealed the decision with the European Court of Justice. The EIB alleges that the General Court, under the Aarhus Convention, misconstrued the notion of an ‘administrative act’, that the EIB decision to approve the loan does not have ‘legally binding and external effect’, and that the General Court was wrong when it classified the EIB’s decision as ‘adopted under environmental law’. A decision by the Court of Justice on the appeal was issued on July 6, 2023 (EIB and Commission/ClientEarth, C-212/21 P and C-223/21 P, EU:C:2023:546).",

MOEA's Regulation for Large Power Consumers entered into force on January 1, 2020, and requires large consumers to transition 10% of their contracted capacity to renewable energy. Plaintiffs challenge two aspects of the regulations.

      "summary": "On May 25, 2020, Greenpeace Mexico filed a lawsuit against the Mexican government contesting the constitutionality of two electricity sector policies that would limit renewables. Greenpeace Mexico asked the Administrative Court to declare the policies unconstitutional for violating the rights to a healthy environment and sustainable development and for obstructing Mexico's compliance with its international commitments to tackle climate change. The two policies challenged were the National Centre of Energy Control (CENACE) Agreement \"to ensure the efficiency, quality, reliability, continuity and safety of the National Electric System, on the occasion of the COVID-19 epidemic\" and the Ministry of Energy policy of \"Reliability, Security, Continuity and Quality in the National Electrical System.\" The former ordered the suspension of certain wind and photovoltaic power plants in operation or on the approval stage prior to commercial operation. The latter supported the CENACE Agreement's suspension of renewable energy power plant operation and the promotion of oil-based power generation. Greenpeace filed the case in the Mexico City's Second District Administrative Court Specialized in Economic Competition, Broadcasting, and Telecommunications.\r\n\r\nOn June 23, 2020, the district court issued a preliminary injunction to suspend the effects of the contested acts. On November 17, 2020, the district court held its main hearing. The Court then issued its judgment that the public policies were unlawfully modifying the rules of the energy market, and were violating the right to a healthy environment of Mexicans. The government appealed the decision to the First Circuit Collegiate Tribunal.\r\n\r\nThe Court decided the contested acts were unconstitutional. First, authorities were not competent to issue the policies. Furthermore, the policies violate the human right to a healthy environment, as well as (i) the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, (ii) the Kyoto Protocol, and (iii) the Paris Agreement (all ratified by Mexico), by imposing a policy that displaces renewable energies, which prevents Mexico from meeting the greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reductions targets to which it committed. The Court considered that the production and consumption of fossil fuels affect the environment to a greater extent, due to the amount of GHG and compounds they produce. The implementation of its provisions undoubtedly implies a risk of damage to the right to a healthy environment, since it encourages the operation of conventional power plants that generate a greater amount of emissions that pollute the environment. The risk of environmental damage is projected in both dimensions (individual and collective), since, on the one hand, it can affect individual health of people and, on the other hand, it does not contribute to mitigate the effects of climate change, which impacts on the universal interest owed to present and future generations to preserve and protect natural resources. Finally, the policies also imply the implementation of regressive measures in relation to the right to a healthy environment, because instead of contributing to increase the goals of minimum participation of clean energies in the generation of electric energy, they reduce or inhibit their progress. The principles upon which the judge based his decision are: (i) in dubio pro natura, (ii) civic participation, (iii) non-regression principle and, (iv) the inclusion of future generations in the notion of progress (any unjustified and significant decrease in the level of environmental protection achieved will affect the heritage to be passed on to the next generation).",

      "summary": "A group called Global Legal Action on Climate Change (GLACC) filed a petition against various government departments including the Climate Change Commission, the Department of Public Works and Highways, the Department of Interior, and Local Government with the Supreme Court of the Philippines seeking relief from dangers arising from flooding, which is expected to become worse and more consequential to Filipinos as climate change intensifies. Specifically, GLACC sought a writ of mandamus from the court that would order government agencies to act on the provisions of two statutes pertaining to flood control: Republic Act 6716 ”the Rainwater Collector and Springs Development Law” requires each Filipino locality to have and maintain a rainwater collector to ensure fresh drinking water is available in times of flooding; Act 7160 or the Local Code of 1991, which establishes the responsibilities of local governments in relation to water management. The suit builds on the writ of kalikasan issued by the Supreme Court in 2009, which established both a Filipino right to environmental protection and a channel for seeking relief from infractions of that right. The petition alleges that noncompliance with the two statutes is rife and increasingly harmful as the Philippines ”the world's most typhoon-prone nation” experiences more frequent and severe storms and flooding. The case was settled when the defendant government departments signed a Memorandum of Understanding and submitted a work plan committing to carry out the required works.",

The Supreme Court rejected the challenges and upheld as proper the government's consideration, based on a consultant report, that new or expanded cement plans could cause further depletion of groundwater and other harmful environmental impacts. As part of its consideration, the Court emphasized the need to for the government to uphold the precautionary principle in protecting the rights to life, sustainability, and dignity of communities surrounding the project areas.

In the filing, the petitioner alleges facts, including that most MS patients suffer from Uhthoff’s syndrome, which is a temperature-dependent sensitivity. The sensitivity causes patients like the petitioner to lose more muscular control as temperatures go up. \r\n\r\nThe petitioner alleges that through inaction on the climate crisis, the Austrian government has violated his constitutional right to family and private life under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) and has allowed foreseeable risks to his right to life under Article 8 and 13 of the ECHR. The petitioner also alleges that he has no effective remedy available in the Austrian legal system, which is a violation of his rights under Article 13 of the ECHR. This is because Austrian law does not provide an opportunity to challenge administrative omissions and legislative inaction on the climate crisis, and no administrative body or court is obliged to hear his claims on the merits.

The 2020 Brazilian NDC would allow the country to reach the year 2030 emitting between 200 million and 400 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) more than proposed in 2015. Youths claimed that the reduction of Brazil's climate ambition through the use of accounting artifice constitutes \"climate pedaling\" and requested an injunction until the effects of the new NDC were determined and it was updated in accordance with the progressiveness required by the Paris Agreement. Youth asked that: (i) the 2020 NDC be declared null; (ii) the defendants present an NDC with the percentages of reduction of CO2e emissions increased beyond the necessary limit, aiming at the fulfillment of the commitment of progressiveness of the Paris Agreement; and (iii) condemning the defendants to pay damages for their actions. \r\n\r\nA monocratic decision was handed down from the Federal Civil Court of São Paulo that recognized the competence of the Court, since the Paris Agreement was signed and promulgated internally, but rejected the injunction, as it was not possible, summarily, to state that the new NDC did not reflect the greatest possible ambition. After the decision, the defendants filed a contestation, alleging preliminarily the absence of domestic jurisdiction to analyze the matter on the grounds that: (i) acts of sovereignty practiced at the international level are not subject to internal control by the ordinary civil jurisdiction and bind States in terms of foreign relations; (ii) no connecting elements between the subjection of the matter to national jurisdiction were presented; (iii) the Paris Agreement provided for its own dispute settlement mechanism; and (iv) there was no harmful act, as Brazil continues to play a leading role in mitigating the effects of climate change with the greatest possible ambition, in addition to the update being in line with the international best practices.\r\n\r\nOn November 30, 2023, the Federal Government signed an agreement with the group of young environmentalists who filed the lawsuit to settle the case and bring it to an end.

      "summary": "On April 21, 2021, a group of Czech citizens filed a lawsuit against the Czech government for its failure to act on climate change and associated human rights violations. The plaintiffs include the climate action NGO Klimatická žaloba ČR, a municipality (Svatý Jan pod Skalou), and four individuals. The defendants are the Ministry of the Environment, the Ministry of Industry and Trade, the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Transport, and the Government of the Czech Republic. The plaintiffs alleged that the government, by failing to adequately address climate change, is violating the rights to life, health, and a sustainable environment of Czech citizens, as guaranteed by the Czech constitution, the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, and the European Convention on Human Rights. The plaintiffs plan to present evidence that the country has a limited carbon budget necessary to meet its constitutional and Paris Agreement obligations and that the government's Climate Protection Policy permits emissions 2.5 times higher than what the carbon budget allows. The plaintiffs seek a court order requiring the government to implement necessary measures to maintain a carbon budget of 800 Mt CO2 from January 2021 until the end of the century and to take essential actions to adapt to climate change. \r\n\r\nOn June 15, 2022, the Prague Municipal Court upheld the lawsuit and ordered the state to urgently take necessary measures to mitigate climate change. The Court ruled that the state’s failure to implement sufficient GHG mitigation measures is unlawful and that the state should refrain from further infringing on the plaintiffs’ rights due to this failure. The court derived the obligation to combat climate change from the Paris Agreement and the EU Climate Law, which sets a target to reduce GHG emissions by 55% by 2030 compared to 1990 levels, as the Czech Republic currently lacks a dedicated climate act. State authorities are required to develop a plan with precise and complete measures to reach this goal, which has yet to be established. While the Court concluded that the objectives of the Paris Agreement, regarding keeping the increase in global temperatures below 2°C, are not legally binding, the Czech Republic's national contribution cannot be overlooked. Neglecting these climate goals would jeopardize the plaintiffs' constitutionally guaranteed rights. The court further noted that the government cannot absolve itself of its climate responsibilities simply by pointing out its minor contribution to climate change.\r\n\r\nRegarding remedies, the Court urged the defendants (Ministry of the Environment, Ministry of Industry and Trade, Ministry of Agriculture, and Ministry of Transport) to implement additional measures aimed at achieving a 55% reduction in GHG emissions by 2030, as the measures outlined in the Climate Protection Policy of the Czech Republic are inadequate to meet the emission reduction target established by the EU. Specifically, the state must take necessary actions to decrease GHG emissions in the sectors of energy, transport, and forestry within six months. However, the adaptation claims put forth by the plaintiffs were rejected since the state is preparing a new adaptation plan and is actively executing certain measures.\r\n\r\nThe Ministry of the Environment appealed on legal grounds to the Supreme Administrative Court of the Czech Republic. On February 20, 2023, the Supreme Administrative Court overturned the decision made by the Prague Municipal Court and sent the case back to the lower court (the Prague Municipal Court). The primary reason for reversing the initial decision is the collective obligation of the EU to reduce its GHG emissions by 55% by 2030, along with the ongoing legislative and political negotiations regarding the specific distribution of these obligations among Member States. In particular, the Supreme Administrative Court found that the Municipal Court did not adequately justify its order for the 55% target by 2030. The Supreme Administrative Court also noted that the plaintiffs must further clarify the specific areas in which the defendants’ alleged inaction violated their obligations, which directly impact the applicants’ rights.\r\n\r\nThe Prague Municipal Court held a public hearing on October 25, 2023, and then dismissed the case. The plaintiffs appealed to the Supreme Administrative Court, which confirmed its earlier opinion and dismissed the case in November 2024. ",

The Belgian National Bank has participated in the European Central Bank's Corporate Sector Purchase Program (CSPP), in which six national central banks purchase bonds from eligible companies to improve financing conditions by lowering debt costs. ClientEarth alleges that over half of bonds purchased under the CSPP were issued by greenhouse-gas intensive sectors and that the program, therefore, exacerbates the climate crisis. ClientEarth alleges that the Belgian National Bank's participation in the CSPP, by not taking into account climate, environment, and human rights impacts, violated Article 11 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU and Article 37 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights (both concern the obligation to integrate environmental protection into EU policies). As part of its case, ClientEarth sought a preliminary reference to the European Court of Justice to determine whether the decision to establish the CSPP was lawful; it argues that it was not because of the failure to take into account climate considerations in designing the CSPP as required by EU law, because the CSPP is itself inconsistent with EU climate policy, and become it undermines the European Union's emissions reduction targets.\r\n\r\nIn December 2021, the Brussels Tribunal of First Instance rejected ClientEarth's application on procedural grounds in a judgment against which ClientEarth launched an appeal in early 2022.

He was ordered to pay a fine of £5000 as well as the costs of the Office of the Attorney General of the UK.\r\n\r\nThe Attorney General's office made the decision to prosecute Crosland for criminal contempt of court following Crosland's widely publicized decision to breach a Supreme Court embargo and reveal the outcome of the judgment in the case of Plan B v. Secretary of State for Transport twenty four hours before it was due to be handed down by the Court. Crosland was given advance access to the judgment through a procedure which allows the parties in a Supreme Court case to comment on any errors of fact or law in Supreme Court judgments. Crosland argued that there was an error of fact regarding the Secretary of State's assessment of the potential impacts of a new third runway at Heathrow. Not only had the Secretary of State made the decision with reference to an outdated 2 degree warming scenario rather than the 1.5 degree scenario adopted as the ultimate goal of the Paris Agreement, but, according to Crosland's submission, the Secretary had subsequently misled parliament and the public about doing so.\r\n\r\nCrosland raised concerns with the Court prior to making the decision to break the embargo in protest of the Plan B v. Secretary of State for Transport judgment. He argued that the Court's unsatisfactory response left him with no option but to breach the embargo in order to publicize and protest the Secretary of State's wrongdoing. During the contempt proceedings, he argued that the disclosure should not be treated as contempt because his decision was a necessary and proportionate response in light of the climate crisis and the huge loss of life that would be incurred by exceeding the 1.5 degree temperature limit. \r\n\r\nAt an appeal hearing on October 18, 2021, Tim Crosland argued that the Supreme Court judges had disregarded his justifications to proceed to the leak, put in doubt their independence and impartiality, and qualified the fine as \"arbitrary and unjust.\" The Attorney General contended that the European Convention on Human Rights' article 10 did not encompass the right \"to be listened or heeded,\" and that Crosland could not jurisdictionally appeal from and to the Supreme Court. His appeal was heard by the only five supreme court justices who were not involved in either the original contempt hearing or the Heathrow ruling.\r\n\r\nOn December 20, 2021, the Supreme Court rejected Crosland's appeal and concluded he could have expressed his views after the judgment was made public. The justices noted that they saw no persuasive evidence that Crosland would not have been able to get his message across if he had complied with the embargo and refrained from discussing the outcome of the Heathrow appeal and his criticisms of the judgment until after it had been handed down. In a separate ruling, Lady Arden highlighted that Crosland’s conduct was “aggravated” by the fact that he is a qualified barrister and therefore would have been “particularly aware of the seriousness of not complying with the court’s directions.” She added: “A barrister plays an essential role in the administration of justice. He owes duties to the court.”",

The case was brought by the Amazon Task Force, established by the federal public prosecutors in 2018 to combat illegal deforestation in Amazonia, through the Ministério Público Federal (MPF), or the federal prosecution office. The MPF brought a tort case against de Rezende for causing the deforestation of 2,488.56 hectares (the equivalent of 4,650 football fields) between 2011 and 2018 in the Amazon, in violation of the right to a healthy environment guaranteed by the Brazilian Constitution. In its preliminary decision, the Court also suspended any paperwork related to the movement of cattle to or from the farms.\r\n\r\nThe MPF further seeks up to R$ 85.4 million (about USD $17 million) in monetary damages from de Rezende for (i) residual material and intermediate climate damage, i.e., the value of emissions that deforestation has caused; (ii) collective pain and suffering as a violation of human rights (moral damages); (iii) intermediate and residual material environmental damages; and (iv) compensation for illegal profits from deforestation.\r\n\r\nOn June 22, 2021, the defendant filed a defense. It claimed that, despite being the owner of the land, it had not committed a criminal act, since the area had been cleared by illegal occupants. He argued that the government was objectively responsible, as it had failed to monitor the environment of the occupants of Fazenda Santa Luiza and the Pae Antimari area. He said that he had not remained inert in the face of the occupations. He explained that, given the invasions of his possession, INCRA had not issued the Title of Recognition of Domain (TRD) and that, as a result, he was unable to apply for environmental licensing before the Amazonas Institute for Environmental Protection (IPAAM) or the Brazilian Institute for the Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (IBAMA). It argued that the area covered by the ACP is not a special preservation area, but a conversion area intended for alternative land use. As for the material damage to the environment, he pointed out that it had been delimited with imprecise data, based on a generic opinion from IBAMA, used universally in other lawsuits. About collective moral damage, he argued that there was no evidence in the case file of any particular social harm to the community in terms of morale. It claimed that there was no causal link between its authorship and the materiality of the environmental damage since the area was degraded by the invaders. It requested (i) that the environmental CPA be extinguished, without resolving the merits; (ii) that the reversal of the burden of proof be prohibited, to the benefit of the defendant; (iii) that the action be dismissed.

      "count": 1,
      "summary": "On May 12, 2021, three climate activists, Jeremy Cox, Mikaela Loach and Karin Van Sweeden (the “Claimants”)  brought a legal challenge in relation to the adoption of the Government’s new Oil and Gas Strategy (the “Strategy”). Their claim was defended by the Oil and Gas Authority (“OGA”) and the Secretary of State for Business Energy and Industrial Strategy (“SoS”; Kwasi Kwarteng). The strategy was laid before Parliament in December 2020, came into force in February 2021, and gives the OGA a dual mandate to both “secure that the maximum value of economically recoverable petroleum is recovered from the strata beneath relevant UK waters” and, in doing so, “to take appropriate steps to assist the Secretary of State in meeting the net zero target.” The strategy sets out plans to support ongoing efforts to exploit North Sea oil and gas reserves. Under the Petroleum Act 1998, the Strategy needs to ensure the maximization of the “economic recovery of UK petroleum.\"\r\n\r\nOn January 18, 2022 the High Court gave judgment, rejecting the Claimants’ two grounds of challenge and dismissing their claim.\r\nThe first of the two grounds alleged error of law and/or frustration of statutory purpose. The Claimants argued that by ignoring the effect of government-backed financial support, the Strategy has stretched the definition of \"economically recoverable\" too wide, such that activities that are not truly \"economic\" for the UK are nonetheless still sought to be maximized through the Strategy. According to the claimants, this endangers the UK’s ability to meet Net Zero, as required under the Climate Change Act 2008. The main issue was therefore whether the OGA's definition of \"economically recoverable\" in its Strategy was consistent with the statutory term \"maximizing the economic recovery of UK petroleum” or whether it frustrates the statutory purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe High Court began its consideration of this ground by considering the court’s role, concluding that the court will afford ‘considerable deference’ to the OGA’s expert view as regulator, and that Parliament, when enacting the legislation, did not intend for the court (rather than the expert regulator) to determine the best method of economic assessment. In any event the High Court agreed with the OGA’s interpretation of the legislative provisions. (Judgment, paragraphs 55 to 114.)\r\n\r\nThe second ground alleged the OGA’s approach was irrational given the UK Government’s net zero target under the Climate Change Act 2008 and statements made by the OGA in relation to that target. The High Court rejected the Claimants’ arguments. The OGA’s approach to the legislation was permissible, as per the Court’s findings under ground one. The question of how to balance various objectives is a matter for the regulator, not the court. The OGA, in consulting on and adopting the Strategy, ‘manifestly had considerable regard to UK domestic action on climate change’. The Claimants’ arguments had ‘no basis in the statute’ and ‘[contradicted] the whole concept of maximizing economic recovery’. (Judgment, paragraphs 115 to 138.)",

      "summary": "On June 5, 2021, environmental justice NGO A Sud and more than 200 plaintiffs filed suit alleging that the Italian government, by failing to take actions necessary to meet Paris Agreement temperature targets, is violating fundamental rights, including the right to a stable and safe climate. The action, part of a campaign called Giudizio Universale (The Last Judgment), seeks a declaration that the government's inaction is contributing to the climate emergency and a court order to reduce emissions 92% by 2030 compared to 1990 levels. According to an executive summary of the claim released by the plaintiffs, the government's climate obligations stem from the Paris Agreement, EU regulations, and IPCC reports. The human right to a stable and safe climate is based on guarantees in Article 6 of the Treaty of the European Union (guarantee of fundamental rights), and Articles 2 (right to life) and 8 (right to privacy) of the European Convention on Human Rights, among others. These rights violations give rise to non-contractual liability of the Italian government under Article 2043 of the Italian Civil Code. \r\n\r\nOn December 14, 2021, the first hearing was held before the Civil Court of Rome in the form of written notes. In its reply, the Presidency of the Council of Ministers, represented by the “Avvocatura Generale dello Stato” (state lawyers), requested the Court to declare the complaint inadmissible and, in any case, to dismiss the applicants’ claims on the merits. On the matter of fact, the reply describes in depth the State’s policies and endeavors on climate change. On the matter of law, the reply deals with: (i) the absence of jurisdiction of the civil judge over activities pertaining to the legislative and executive powers of the State; (ii) the lack of standing rights of the applicants; (iii) the impossibility of placing an individual responsibility on the Italian State for climate change and its impact. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe applicants sent their rebuttal notes on January 14, 2022. The second hearing (the first oral hearing) has been held on 21 June 2022. The parties presented their legal arguments before the judge. The judge scheduled the next hearing for September 13, 2023.\r\n\r\nFollowing the final hearing on 13 September 2023, the Judge of the Second Civil Section of the Court of Rome requested the parties' closing statements and proceeded with the ruling.\r\n\r\nIn its judgment of February 26, 2024, the Court declared the claims inadmissible for absolute lack of jurisdiction (‘difetto assoluto di giurisdizione’). \r\n\r\nThe Court applied the principle of separation of powers and the related case law. The Court pointed out that the claim entails a review of the sphere of powers that the Constitution reserves to the legislature. \r\n\r\nIn the Court's opinion, \"the interest for which compensation is claimed under Articles 2043 and 2051 of the Italian Civil Code does not fall within the category of legally protected subjective interests, since decisions relating to the methods and timescales for managing the phenomenon of anthropogenic climate change - which involve discretionary socio-economic assessments and in terms of cost-benefit in the various sectors of human life - fall within the sphere of attribution of the political bodies and cannot be sanctioned in the present proceedings. With the proposed civil action, the plaintiffs essentially ask the Court to annul the measures, including primary and secondary regulatory measures (...) that constitute the implementation of the political choices of the legislature and the government for the achievement of the objectives assumed at international and European level (in the short and long term) in violation of a cardinal principle of the order represented by the principle of separation of powers\" (unofficial English translation, p. 12 of the judgment).  \r\n\r\nA Sud appealed the court ruling, but a new ruling will not be made until October 21, 2026.

      "id": "Lawyers for Climate Action NZ Incorporated v. The Climate Change Commission",
      "type": "case",
      "count": 1,
      "summary": "New Zealand’s Climate Change Response Act 2002 (as amended 2019) (Act) sets a goal of net-zero emissions by 2050 (2050 Target), and created the He Pou a Rangi | the Climate Change Commission (Commission) to provide periodic expert advice to the government in meeting that goal. \r\n\r\nOn July 1 2021, Lawyers for Climate Action NZ Inc (LCANZI) filed a judicial review application against the Commission and Minister for Climate Change (Minister) arguing that advice provided by the Commission to the Minister was unlawful. LCANZI is an incorporated society of over 300 lawyers seeking to ensure more effective action in Aotearoa New Zealand against climate change. \r\n\r\nThe Commission had provided advice for the purpose of setting New Zealand’s first three domestic emissions budgets under the Act (Budgets Advice), and on whether Aotearoa New Zealand’s then current nationally determined contribution (the 2016 NDC) was compatible with contributing to the global effort under the Paris Agreement to limit global average temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels (the 1.5°C Goal) - the Commission advised on the level of commitment that would be compatible with that effort (NDC Advice). \r\n\r\nNDC Advice \r\nLCANZI challenged that advice as being based on a faulty methodology which amounted to an “error of logic” ([81]). The Commission compared the level of New Zealand’s international commitment (as set out in the 2016 NDC) with modelling in the IPCC’s 2018 Special Report. That modelling was of different global pathways that would be consistent with the 1.5°C Goal, comparing net emissions in the target year that would be consistent with net emissions in a base year (a net:net measure) to derive a percentage reduction. The Commission applied this modelling to New Zealand’s gross emissions in the base year (a gross:net measure) to derive a percentage reduction by the target year that would be consistent with the 1.5°C Goal. LCANZI argued that it was an error to use the gross:net measure, as it meant that the NDC Advice understated the level of reductions necessary to be consistent with the 1.5°C Goal, and was unlawful, irrational, and unreasonable. \r\n\r\nBudgets Advice \r\nIn terms of the Budgets Advice, budgets must be set with “with a view to meeting the 2050 target and contributing to the global effort under the Paris Agreement to limit the global average temperature increase to 1.5° Celsius above pre-industrial levels” (s 5W, s 3). LCANZI argued that the Commission impermissibly focused only on the 2050 Target, rather than the 1.5°C limit, and further the Commission had pursued “economically affordable” budgets rather than the statutory requirement that budgets be “ambitious but likely to be technically and economically affordable” (s 5ZC). \r\n\r\nLCANZI further challenged the accounting methodology recommended by the Commission to measure progress towards meeting emissions budgets and the 2050 Target. LCANZI contended that the legislation mandated Greenhouse Gas Inventory accounting (GHGI Accounting) whereas the Commission recommended modified activity-based accounting (MAB Accounting). LCANZI argued that the Commission erred in law in recommending MAB Accounting, the consequence of which it risked portraying a false sense of ambition of the level of emissions reductions in the budgets than the emissions that the atmosphere would actually see during the budget periods. \r\n\r\nLastly, LCANZI contended that the Budgets Advice was irrational, unreasonable and inconsistent with the legislative purpose of contributing to the global 1.5°C effort, as it would ultimately allow for emissions to increase over the 2010 - 2030 period. \r\n\r\nHigh Court decision \r\nOn November 23, 2022, the High Court rejected all four claims. As a preliminary issue, Mallon J held that advice from the Commission was reviewable, despite its status as advice rather than traditional government decision-making. This is because it is public advice, with public consequences that are separate from the consequences of the Minister’s ultimate decision ([65]). \r\n\r\nIn terms of the NDC Advice, Mallon J held that the Commission did not make a mathematical or logical error in its application of the IPCC Modelling, as it did not intend to make a direct mathematical comparison, using the IPCC modelling only as an indirect comparator. Mallon J held that the NDC Advice “was potentially misleading (particularly to lay readers or anyone without the time to read the Advice in its full detail)”, to the extent that it could be interpreted as advice that reductions of 36% below 2005 gross levels would be compatible with the IPCC Modelling ([119]). However, Mallon J went on to find that “while it might have been more transparent to carry out a strictly mathematical comparison and to then adjust for value judgments, the Commission did not make a serious logical error that led to an irrational recommendation. The Commission knew what it was doing and had reasons for its approach. It meant that its NDC Advice on consistency with the 1.5°C global effort was not based entirely on a truly mathematical comparison with the IPCC 1.5°C global pathways” ([127]). Further, the Minister, as the decision-maker, had been made aware of the Commission’s approach ([125]). \r\n\r\nIn terms of the Budgets Advice, Mallon J held that the Commission had correctly understood its role as being to provide advice, taking into account both the 2050 Target and contributing to the global 1.5°C effort. Mallon J found that LCANZI sought to elevate the statutory purpose to contribute to the global 1.5°C effort as a primary, independent, and enforceable duty ([162]). Mallon J agreed with the Minister that the words “contribute to” are more consistent with an aspiration, rather than an obligation ([162]).\r\n\r\nThirdly, Mallon J held that the Commission did not err in law by recommending MAB Accounting as the accounting methodology to measure progress, holding that the Act empowered the Commission to give advice on the appropriate accounting methodology. \r\n\r\nFinally, Mallon J held that the Commission’s Advice was not irrational or unreasonable. While Mallon J held that LCANZI was “correct that neither the NDC Advice nor the Budgets Advice put New Zealand on track to reduce domestic emissions by 2030 as per the IPCC global pathways”, the legislation did not require this in order to contribute to the global 1.5°C effort.  \r\n\r\nOn December 21, 2022, LCANZI sought leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal, which was granted. On March 28, 2025, the Court of Appeal released its judgment. The Court of Appeal agreed with the High Court that the Commission’s advice was, in principle, amenable to judicial review. However, the Court dismissed the grounds of review, largely adopting the reasoning of the High Court. While the Court of Appeal agreed that emissions budgets are intended to serve the dual purpose of the Act, being both the 2050 Target and contributing to the goal of limiting warming to 1.5°C, it did not accept that this makes contributing to the 1.5°C goal a substantive bottom-line requirement under the Act ([104]). While LCANZI argued that a budget allowing for an increase in net emissions over the budget period will be contrary to the purpose of the Act and unlawful, the Court of Appeal held that it does not necessarily follow that an increase in net emissions in a particular budget period means that the series of emissions budgets of which it forms part of have not been set with a view to contributing to the global effort to achieve the 1.5°C goal ([107]). \r\n\r\nOn April 30 2025, LCANZI sought leave to appeal to the Supreme Court. LCANZI is seeking to bring two arguments to the Supreme Court (not continuing the accounting methodology and unreasonableness challenge). First, LCANZI is asking the Court to find that New Zealand’s emissions budgets are not consistent with the purpose of the Act, which is to: “provide a framework by which New Zealand can develop and implement clear and stable climate change policies that contribute to the global effort under the Paris Agreement to limit the global average temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels”. Second, that the approach taken by the Commission in the NDC Advice was unlawful as it was not mathematically meaningful or logical, and did not provide a valid basis either to assess whether the NDC was consistent with the 1.5°C goal, or for the Minister to decide to adopt a new NDC, and was not communicated in a transparent or readily understandable way.",

      "type": "case",
      "count": 1,
      "summary": "In May 2021, four NGOs (AGAPAN, INGÁ, COONATERRA-BIONATUR and CEPPA) filed a request for precautionary measures against the Brazilian environmental agency, IBAMA, and Copelmi, a mining company, related to an open-pit coal mining project within the Nova Seival coal-fired power plant, which, if approved, will be the largest coal power plant in Brazil. The plaintiffs identified a series of irregularities in the permitting process, including: (i) inadequate public participation, (ii) the lack of analysis of the EIA by the environmental agency, and (iii) the risks and impacts caused by the project. The request was subsequently converted into a public civil action. The plaintiffs sought to suspend a public hearing and the permitting procedure until several material issues with the EIA are resolved. The Ministério Público, asked to opine on the case, specifically noted the need to undertake a strategic environmental assessment and asked for the assessment of climate change impacts in the general terms of reference for EIAs related to thermal power stations. \r\n\r\nOn August 18, 2020, the Public Prosecutor's Office filed a statement on the case, requesting that: (i) the anticipation of relief claimed by the plaintiffs be granted, with subsequent annulment of the public hearing, (ii) the immediate suspension of the UTE's environmental licensing process Nova Seival until the defects pointed out by IBAMA are remedied, (iii) held at least three public hearings in the cities of Porto Alegre, Hulha Negra or Candiota, (iv) acknowledged the omissions present in the EIA/RIMA and (v) summoned IBAMA for the presentation of a merit analysis study and the EIA/RIMA, prepared by a multidisciplinary team.\r\n\r\nOn August 31, 2021, the court partially granted the precautionary measures to (i) annul the public hearing previously held, (ii) suspend the permitting procedure of the Nova Seival coal-fired power plant until the irregularities in the EIA are addressed, (iii) hold at least three public hearings, and (iv) include specific requirements in the terms of reference of thermoelectric power plants in the state of Rio Grande do Sul related to climate change, the need for a strategic environmental evaluation, and potential risks to public health. The requirements to assess potential climate change damages are grounded in the National Policy of Climate Change and the State Law No. 13.594/2010 (state policy on climate change) in the terms of reference of permitting procedures of thermal power stations in the state of Rio Grande do Sul. \r\n\r\nOn August 12, 2022, a judgment was handed down in which the court: (i) accepted the Union's preliminary illegitimacy of passive standing, as it understood that there was no claim directed at the entity; and (ii) dismissed Copelmi's preliminary illegitimacy of passive standing, understanding that the company is related to the project. On the merits, the court highlighted the climate issue, emphasizing the UN General Assembly's recognition of a clean, healthy, and sustainable environment as a universal human right, and various other jurisdictional positions on the climate emergency. Thus, it ratified the conclusions reached in the trial in which the injunction was granted. It held that there had been no effective participation by the affected populations in the environmental licensing procedure. It considered that participation should be allowed through transparent and accessible information. It emphasized the importance of measuring the synergistic and cumulative impacts resulting from the Nova Seival TPP and the Seival Mine, and that environmental licensing should not be split up. In this way, an effective analysis of the environmental impact is possible, including the climate impact. It highlighted the measures provided for in the Paris Agreement (enacted by Federal Decree 9.073/2017), the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change - UNFCCC (enacted by Federal Decree 2.652/1998), the PNMC, and the PGMC. It also considered that the environmental study presented did not provide for mitigation or compensation measures for GHG emissions, as provided for in IBAMA's Normative Instruction, nor did it analyze air quality standards. It emphasized that the principle of prevention applies, given that there is legal certainty of environmental damage with the installation and operation of the project. Regarding the strategic environmental assessment study, it considered necessary to carry it out based on the Rio Grande do Sul State Policy on Climate Change, which is the most beneficial and protective environmental standard. It highlighted the principle of the integrity of the climate system. Finally, it upheld the plaintiffs' claims and concluded that the environmental licensing of the UTE disagreed with the technical, regulatory, and legal standards of the case and with the commitments signed at the international level by Brazil, as it ignored transgenerational health and climate issues.\r\n\r\nAGAPAN, Instituto Gaúcho de Estudos Ambientais, Instituto Preservar, COONATERRA - Bionatur and CEPPA filed an appeal.\r\n",

      "summary": "In October 2020, Greenpeace brought a case against the U.K. government for awarding BP Plc a permit to drill for 30 million barrels of oil in the North Sea. Greenpeace is challenging the permit on the grounds that the government allegedly failed (i) its legal duty to assess climate impacts, since it only weighed the effects of emissions from production, and not from the consumption of the oil extracted; (ii) to comply with public consultation requirements; and (iii) to assess how much flaring (the controlled burning of natural gas) would take place as a result of the permit being granted. Greenpeace asked the court to overturn the government’s decision to grant BP a permit for the Vorlich oil field. The lack of access to information throughout the permitting process was previously questioned by Greenpeace in another case. \r\n\r\nThe original license for the Vorlich field was granted in 1981, when no obligations or legislation existed to regulate climate impacts. In 2018, the Oil and Gas Authority (OGA) approved the development of BP’s 200 million-pound ($275 million) Vorlich project, with the consent of the Secretary of State, which carries out the Environmental Statement process, and granted a final permit to extract 30 million barrels of oil. In 2020, the notice of the Secretary of State’s agreement to the consent, and the OGA’s grant of consent in relation to the Vorlich field were published. BP began extraction from Vorlich in November 2020 and expects to extract 20,000 barrels of oil per day at peak production.\r\n\r\nA hearing was held in September 2021. According to news reports, the UK government argued during the hearing that the legal duty to consider indirect impacts of oil drilling on climate change (scope 3 emissions) did not extend to the emissions coming from burning oil extracted and that assessing such emissions would be impossible. A decision from a panel of three judges is pending. \r\n\r\nOn October 7, 2021 a three judge panel from the Scottish Court of Sessions dismissed the case. The Court confirmed that the matters under consideration, including the issue of consumption emissions, could be considered on the merits by the court despite the previous proceedings. Nonetheless, the Court dismissed the contention that the Secretary of State should have considered the consumption based emissions associated with the project. The Court argued that there was no duty to consider consumption based emissions from the project as part of the environmental impact assessment of the project, arguing that the question of whether the development of new oil and gas projects should cease is a political and not a legal one.",

      "summary": "On September 20, 2021, Environment Victoria launched a legal action against the Environment Protection Authority (EPA) and AGL Energy, EnergyAustralia, and Alinta, owners of Victoria’s three remaining coal-burning power stations. The plaintiffs question EPA’s review of three power station licenses, which lacked more stringent limits on GHG emissions. Environment Victoria argues that the EPA has failed to require best practice management of toxic emissions, take proper account of the environmental principles in the Environment Protection Act and consider key sections of the 2017 Climate Change Act. Environment Australia asks the court to revoke, amend, and attach certain conditions to the licenses. \r\n\r\nIn November 2017, the EPA announced the review of Victoria’s coal power stations. In March 2021, the EPA announced new license conditions for the state’s three remaining coal power stations. In August 2021, the EPA granted the permits and capped GHG emissions at “approximately current levels,” instead of lowering the required standards. Victoria’s Climate Change Act requires the EPA to consider climate change in their review of coal power station licenses, which, according to the plaintiffs, the EPA failed to do. The emissions form the coal-burning power stations represent about 40% of Victoria’s total emissions. The plaintiffs also question the limits on toxic air pollution, including sulfur dioxide, fine particles (PM2.5) and mercury. \r\n\r\nThe trial commenced before Justice James Gorton of the Victorian Supreme Court on October 18, 2022.

      "summary": "On August 26, 2021, Guy and Kim Abrahams as trustees for the Abrahams Family Trust, shareholders in the Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA), filed an application in the Federal Court of Australia, seeking access to internal documents under the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth). The documents relate to the bank’s reported involvement with several projects including a gas pipeline in the US, a gas project in Queensland, a gas field and an oil field, among other projects that potentially infringe the bank’s Environmental and Social Framework (E&S Framework) and Environmental and Social Policy (E&S Policy). In particular, the E&S Framework and the E&S Policy require that the bank carries out an assessment of the environmental, social and economic impacts of the projects and whether the projects are in line with the goals of the Paris Agreement.\r\n\r\nOn November 4, 2021, the Federal Court of Australia held a hearing to consider proposed consent orders that had been agreed by the parties in previous correspondence. In essence, the proposed consent orders allow the Plaintiffs to inspect a limited scope of the documents sought at the beginning of the proceedings. The plaintiffs’ legal representative made short oral submissions on the evidence before the Court in order to establish that the plaintiffs were acting in good faith and that inspection was to be made for a proper purpose, as is required by law. CBA made a limited admission to the same effect. On the basis of the limited admission and the evidence before the Court, the Court was satisfied that the plaintiffs met the good faith and proper purpose requirements and made the consent orders. CBA must now produce the relevant documents to the plaintiffs for inspection in two tranches on December 9, 2021 and February 10, 2022. If the documents provided by CBA under these orders do not sufficiently alleviate the plaintiffs’ concerns as set out in their application, the plaintiffs have reserved their right to apply to the Court for production of the balance of documents sought in the original application.\r\n\r\nThe matter was listed for a further case management hearing on March 10, 2022. On November 1, 2022, the Court granted the plaintiffs the right to access information regarding the Bank's compliance with its environmental policies and commitments.

The ZLEV Act, adopted in July 2021, introduces a new tax that charges electric vehicle drivers between 2 and 2.5 cents for every kilometer they drive. In addition, drivers of electric vehicles are required to submit annual odometer readings to state authorities from which an annual charge is calculated.

The petition calls for the federal government, the Brazilian Institute for the Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (IBAMA), the Chico Mendes Institute for Biodiversity Conservation (ICMBio) and the National Indigenous Foundation (Funai) to work together to contain the action of loggers, miners, land grabbers, among other agents in deforestation hotspots through command-and-control measures.\r\n\r\nThe petition is grounded in scientific data that highlights the significant increase in deforestation in 2020, along with a reduction of federal inspection activity by the environmental agencies. The petition is grounded on the Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of Deforestation in the Legal Amazon (PPCDAm). The PPCDAm follows Brazil’s target under the Paris Agreement and the National Policy on Climate Change of reducing deforestation in Amazonia by 80% by 2020, based on the 1996-2005 average. \r\n\r\nThe MPF calls on the different government bodies to present an enforcement plan and rapid timeline to implement the necessary mechanisms to contain illegal deforestation.

The plaintiffs relied on the German Constitution (Basic Law) to call on the state legislature to set a GHG emissions reduction pathway, to comply with the remaining CO2 budget and adopt sufficient instruments to achieve and verify the climate protection targets set by the Paris Agreement.\r\n\r\nNRW is the German state with the biggest population and the highest greenhouse gas emissions. The 2013 NRW Climate Protection Act was revised on July 1, 2021, increasing the climate protection targets for 2030 (greenhouse gas emissions reduction by 65%), 2040 (greenhouse gas emissions reduction by 88%) and 2045 (achieve carbon neutrality). However, according to the plaintiffs, the interim targets set for the time periods until 2030 and between 2030 and 2040 are insufficient, as they allow emissions to continue to rise in individual emitting sectors. In addition, legal instruments with specific deadlines to track and meet greenhouse gas reduction targets were deleted from the law. In particular, the adopted state law no longer requires the state government to prepare and implement a legally binding climate protection plan to be updated every five years, nor to specify the measures necessary to meet its reduction goals. This obligation was replaced by the introduction of a so-called climate protection audit, which is supposed to ‘accompany’ the strategies and measures of the state government and to ‘serve as an aid’ without providing for any binding targets or intermediate goals. \r\n\r\nThe plaintiffs relied on the Constitutional Court’s decision in <a href=\"https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/neubauer-et-al-v-germany/\">Neubauer v. Germany</a>, following which Germany adjusted its climate goals at the federal level. Plaintiffs argued that codification of a legally binding reduction path is also required at the state level, as states bear co-responsibility for protecting lives and civil liberties, including safeguarding the natural foundations of life for future generations, within their own sphere of competence. Plaintiffs argued that the NRW law falls short of these constitutional requirements.

The communication was filed under Article 15 of the Rome Statute of the ICC, which allows the Prosecutor to make a request to the Pre-Trial Chamber to authorize an investigation into crimes within the jurisdiction of the court on the basis of information received from third parties.\r\n \r\nThe communication alleges that President Bolsonaro has promoted and facilitated a “widespread attack” on the Amazon Biome and “those who defend and depend upon it” which represents “a clear and extant threat to humanity itself.” The complaint argues that global climate security is dependent on the Amazon and its key role in regulating global temperatures and weather patterns, and that the “severe damage to the functions of the Amazon Biome caused by deforestation, conversion of deforested land to cattle ranching, and vast intentional forest fires” has disrupted this critical ecosystem turning it from a carbon sink to a carbon source.\r\n \r\nThe communication argues that through damage and destruction to the rainforest President Bolsonaro’s administration has inflicted, continues to inflict, and foreseeably risks inflicting “profound suffering and loss of life on local, regional and global populations alike.” It emphasizes that this is particularly true in the case of local populations living in the Amazon. These local populations are described in the complaint at “Environmental Dependents and Defenders.” The complaint argues that these populations are the victims of ongoing and intentional persecution by the Brazilian government, conducted in furtherance of a state policy, that amount to crimes against humanity contrary to Article 7 and Article 25(3)c) of the Rome Statute. It argues that since the Brazilian authorities are unable to carry out proceedings against Mr. Bolsonaro and his collaborators, the complaint should be admissible before the ICC under Article 17 of the Rome Statute.\r\n",

The complaint was submitted on behalf of five young Australians aged between 14 and 24 years old. It relies on the particular climate vulnerability of young people, First Nations people and people with disabilities, as climate change exacerbates existing inequalities and directly undermines their health and cultural rights.\r\n\r\nThe complainants rely on the recently recognized right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment by the U.N.

Torres Strait Islander communities face an existential threat due to rising sea levels from climate change. If global temperatures rise more than 1.5oC many of the islands will become uninhabitable. The sea level in the Torres Strait (also known as Zenadth Kes) has risen about six centimeters over the past decade. Without deep emissions cuts, sea levels are projected to rise to a meter or more above present day levels by 2100. The plaintiffs claim that as the ocean rises it will flood and destroy their irreplaceable cultural heritage and sacred sites. This includes burial sites, locations that contain human remains and places that have a spiritual significance.\r\n\r\nThe plaintiffs present scientific evidence proving that the following climate change-induced impacts already threaten their native title rights and Ailan Kastom, the Torres Strait people's distinctive customary culture: (i) higher temperature, (ii) ocean acidification and higher ocean temperature, (iii) sea-level rise and associated flooding and erosion, (iv) increase in the frequency, size and/or intensity of extreme weather events such as terrestrial and marine heatwaves, severe storms, and flooding, (v) harm and destruction of terrestrial and marine ecosystems and non-human species - coral reefs, and (vi) harm to human health. A continued failure to act will result in the triggering of so-called tipping points making the Torres Strait becoming uninhabitable.\r\n\r\nThe applicants plaintiffs allege that the following climate change-induced impacts already threaten their native title rights and Ailan Kastom, the Torres Strait people's distinctive customary culture: (i) higher temperature, (ii) ocean acidification and higher ocean temperature, (iii) sea-level rise and associated flooding and erosion, (iv) increase in the frequency, size and/or intensity of extreme weather events such as terrestrial and marine heatwaves, severe storms, and flooding, (v) harm and destruction of terrestrial and marine ecosystems and non-human species - coral reefs, and (vi) harm to human health. A continued failure to act is likely to result in the triggering of so-called tipping points making the Torres Strait uninhabitable. \r\n\r\nThe applicants allege that the Commonwealth owes a duty of care to Torres Strait Islanders to take reasonable steps to protect them, their culture and traditional way of life, and their environment from harms caused by climate change, and that the government has breached this duty as the targets are not consistent with the best available science. Additionally, they argue that the government has breached this duty, including by failing to identify an emissions reduction target and take the as the targets are not consistent with the best available science and implement such measures as are necessary to reduce Australia’s emissions consistent with that target. Pursuant to the Torres Strait Treaty, Australia is indeed require to take legislative and other action to protect and preserve the marine environment in and in the vicinity of the protected zone, and/or take measures for the prevention and control of pollution or other damage to the marine environment from all sources and activities under its jurisdiction or control. The applicants seek an order requiring the federal government to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and prevent the inundation of islands in the Torres Strait through the implementation of necessary measures to protect their land and marine environment, cultural and customary rights.

      "summary": "The University Superannuation Scheme (“the Scheme”) is one of the largest private occupational pension schemes in the UK. It provides superannuation benefits for academic and comparable staff in universities and other higher education institutions. The Scheme is administered by its corporate trustee, Universities Superannuation Scheme Limited (\"the Company\"), a company limited by guarantee with no shareholders.\r\n\r\nThe claimant academics are members of the Scheme. Through this common law derivative claim they sought permission to continue proceedings on behalf of the Company against its directors for breach of their directors' duties, alleging the following:\r\n\r\n- The Scheme continues to invest in fossil fuels and, despite the Company’s stated ambition to be carbon neutral by 2050, its directors had no divestment plan, in breach of the directors’ duties in sections 171 and 172 of the Companies Act 2006.\r\n- Further, or in the alternative, in failing to have a plan, the directors failed to take into account a number of relevant considerations, including the results of a members' ethical survey. The long-term interests of the Company and the Scheme could only be met by \"an immediate plan for disinvestment\" and that the only \"rational action\" that the directors could take pursuant to sections 171 and 172 was \"devise and implement such a plan as soon as possible.\"\r\n- The failure to take such steps had prejudiced the success of the Company which had suffered loss in consequence. The directors' breaches \"furthered their own interests\" and the directors \"put their own beliefs with regard to fossil fuels above the interests of the beneficiaries and the Company.\"\r\n\r\nThe claimants sought declarations that the absence of a divestment plan constituted a breach of statutory and fiduciary duties, and that such breaches caused loss to the Company.\r\n\r\nIn August 2022, the High Court refused the claimants permission to proceed. The Court of Appeal, upholding that decision in July 2023, held:\r\n- This cannot be characterized as a derivative action. There was no prima facie case of loss to the Company as a result of the alleged breaches of directors’ duties, meaning the claim fell at the first\r\nhurdle.\r\n- Also, it was not alleged the claimants suffered any loss as a result of the alleged breaches. Nor was it suggested the directors were acting in bad faith, or had done other than acted in what they considered to\r\nbe the best interests of the Company and the Scheme, having taken proper advice.\r\n- There was no evidence the alleged directors’ breaches furthered their own interests or that the directors' actions put their own beliefs with regards to fossil fuels above the interests of the beneficiaries and the Company. It was doubtful there was a prima facie case in this regard.\r\n- In effect, this was an attempt to challenge the Company’s management and investment decisions as trustee without any ground upon which to do so. There was nothing to suggest the Company has exercised its powers in an improper fashion.\r\n- The claim was well suited to be brought as a direct claim in breach of trust and there was no reason, save perhaps a desire to avoid certain procedural burdens, to seek to bring it in as a derivative action. The derivative procedural mechanism is not intended to enable would be claimants to avoid other procedural hurdles. It is an exceptional remedy when a wrong would otherwise go unremedied. In effect, the claim was a challenge to the Company’s investment policy and should have been brought against it as just that.",

      "summary": "On October 26, 2021, Observatório do Clima (OC), a network of 71 civil society organizations, filed a class action at the federal court of Amazonas against the Environmental Ministry and Brazilian government. The plaintiffs request that the National Climate Change Policy be updated according to the best available science, the seriousness of the climate emergency, and the latest IPCC report (AR6) to ensure the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) by the Brazilian government consistent with a 1.5oC global warming scenario. The plaintiffs assert that climate change affects the constitutionally recognized right to a healthy environment, as well as fundamental rights such as the right to life, dignity, health, food, and housing, along with several recognized principles of international environmental law. The plaintiffs refer to the latest IPCC report to attest to the urgency of the case and the likely damages that will occur in the case of inaction from the Brazilian government. \r\n\r\nPlaintiffs argue that, as a signatory to the Paris Agreement, Brazil has committed to a series of duties to mitigate climate change. Along with the existing legal climate framework in Brazil (i.e., the Law on Climate Change Policy and the National Climate Change Plan), this entails a duty from the Brazilian government to (i) take the necessary measures to predict, avoid and minimize the identified causes of climate change originating in the national territory; (ii) reduce anthropogenic GHG emissions in relation to their different sources; (iii) make the instruments of the national policy effective; (iv) present successive phases of the national plan; and (v) strive for the maximum possible ambition in reducing GHGs.\r\n\r\nBrazil represents one of the world’s largest GHG emitters. Yet, the majority of emissions arise from deforestation rather than from energy sources and transportation. Through the Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) published in 2016, Brazil committed to reducing GHG emissions by 37% by 2025 and by 43% by 2030 based on emissions from 2005. On December 2020, the government presented its updated NDC. The new NDC used the same percentage of emissions reductions, but altered the baseline quantity for calculating them, effectively making the second NDC less ambitious than the first. Additionally, Brazil had committed to reducing deforestation by 80% by 2030 in 2015 – this provision was deleted from the updated NDC. The plaintiffs assert that the updated NDC effectively violates the Paris Agreement and the national legal framework and the principle of non-regression.\r\n\r\nOn November 4, 2021, the court scheduled a preliminary conciliatory hearing for November 25, 2021. However, on November 24, 2021, conciliatory hearing was canceled, in view of the Union's manifestation of no interest in the consensual composition of the dispute.\r\n\r\nOn May 13, 2022, the court rejected the request to combine the case with Six Youths v.

Argentina</a>) submitted a petition to United Nations (U.N.) Secretary-General António Guterres asking him to declare a climate emergency. The petitioners rely on the impacts of climate change on human rights, specifically the rights of children as recognized by the U.N. and its several agencies, including the recent decision of the Committee on the Rights of the Child. The petitioners call on the Secretary-General and the Inter-Agency Standing Committee (IASC) to declare a systemwide, Level 3 climate emergency at the U.N. The petitioners further encourage the IASC and the Chief Executives Board for Coordination (CEB) to mobilize a U.N. Comprehensive Response to the Climate Emergency and activate a crisis management team to oversee immediate and comprehensive global action on climate. \r\n\r\nDeclaring a Level 3 Emergency, the U.N.’s highest designation, would mean placing climate action at the top of the agenda for each U.N. agency. This would ensure that U.N. resources and personnel can be deployed rapidly to dispatch aid and scientific expertise to countries most vulnerable to climate disasters. It would also ensure that the U.N. can help countries meet their emission reduction pledges on an urgent, emergency basis. The petitioners assert that a U.N. Comprehensive Response to the Climate Emergency is necessary (i) as international human rights law requires states to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions that have transboundary effects, (ii) to address the fundamental inequities of climate change, and (iii) to provide a legal response to the youth and fulfill the U.N. Charter’s promise to protect succeeding generations. \r\n\r\nAccording to the petitioners, the U.N.’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic provides the blueprint for climate action. In the face of the pandemic, the Secretary-General and the IASC mobilized a U.N. Comprehensive Response to the global health crisis and activated a U.N. Crisis Management Team.

The NGO argued that the NDC failed to respect the principle of non-regression in human rights law. In its original 2015 NDC, Mexico committed to a 22% reduction in GHG emissions by 2030 as compared to 2000 levels. In the revised NDC presented in December 2020, Mexico raised the baseline against which the GHG emission reduction is measured. Greenpeace argued that the updated NDC would effectively cause the additional emission of 14 million tons of CO2e; (ii) eliminate the peak of GHG emissions stipulated for 2026; (iii) rule out the 50% reduction target for 2050, which would nullify the mitigation horizon in the medium and long term. Greenpeace asked the court to suspend the effects of the 2020 NDC. \r\n\r\nOn July 14, 2021, the Judge ruled against Greenpeace. On July 30, 2021, Greenpeace appealed the decision.

      "summary": "In September 2019, the Surrey County Council granted planning permission to Horse Hill Developments Ltd for the retention and extension of the Horse Hill Well Site, Surrey, and to drill four new wells, to produce hydrocarbons (crude oil) over a 25-year period. The environmental statement issued by the developer provided an assessment of the direct (scope 1 and 2) greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with the project but did not assess the emissions that would subsequently be produced as a result of using the product (scope 3 emissions). The Council treated the scope 3 emissions as beyond the EIA's scope. \r\n\r\nThe claimant, Sarah Finch, a local resident in Surrey and a climate activist, applied for judicial review of Surrey County Council’s decision to grant planning permission, citing serious concerns about the effects which the extraction and use of hydrocarbons would have on climate change. She argued that SCC’s failure to consider these emissions in determining whether to approve the project was a breach of the UK’s obligations under European Union Law (Directive 2011/92/EU, the EIA Directive) as implemented in domestic law by the EIA Regulations 2017. She contended that either SCC had misinterpreted the relevant national regulations in determining that the consumption-based emissions could be excluded from the assessment, or that the relevant regulations were unlawful because they were in conflict with the EIA Directive. She also argued that the consumption emissions from the project should have been considered in relation to the UK’s net zero target.\r\n\r\nOn July 15, 2020, the judge granted permission to apply for judicial review and identified a challenge to national planning policy on the ground that it is not in conformity with EU law. The claim then proceeded in the High Court. On October 20, 2020, the Secretary of State for Housing, Communities and Local Government was joined as an interested party to respond to the new grounds related to national planning policy. Friends of the Earth was granted permission to intervene.\r\n\r\nOn December 21, 2020, the case was dismissed by the High Court on the basis that “the assessment of GHG emissions from the future combustion of refined oil products...was, as a matter of law, incapable of falling within the scope to the EIA required by the 2017 Regulations for the planning application.” The case was subsequently appealed on the basis that the court erred in its interpretation of the 2017 Regulations. . Friends of the Earth was again granted permission to intervene. \r\n\r\nThe Court of Appeal hearing took place in November 2021. At the hearing, the Appellant argued: \r\n•\tThat the High Court had taken an overly narrow interpretation of the EIA regime which was not aligned with established national and EU case law precedent. \r\n•\tFurthermore, there was an imbalance between the weight afforded by the decision-maker to the benefits that the use of the extracted oil would bring, and the lack of consideration of the climate impacts of this usage.\r\n•\tIt was advanced that the climate impact resulting from the end-use consumption of the oil extracted must be considered under the EIA regime. \r\n•\tAdditionally, that the Council’s reasons and consequently decision to exclude the end-use emissions from the EIA were inconsistent and legally flawed. \r\n•\tThe Appellant argued further that it is feasible to measure scope 3 emissions whilst still ensuring that the EIA regime is achievable in practice. \r\n\r\nFriends of the Earth supported the Appellant’s arguments, and referred to case law on EIA from other jurisdictions, to point to the workability of assessing scope 3 emissions from fossil fuel projects. The Court of Appeal’s decision was handed down on the February 17, 2022. The decision was split 2:1. The majority ruling was that SCC’s decision to grant planning permission without the EIA considering the end-use GHG emissions was lawful as the Surrey County Council was entitled to decide as a question of “fact and judgment” whether the Development’s scope 3 emissions fell within the assessment required by the 2017 Regulations. The dissenting judge, Lord Justice Moylan, concluded that the Council’s decision was unlawful. \r\n\r\nThis case was heard by the Supreme Court in June 2023, with the court reserving its judgment. Friends of the Earth and the Office for Environmental Protection both intervened in the challenge. \r\n\r\nOn June 20, 2024, the Supreme Court decided (by a majority of three to two) that the Surrey County Council’s decision to grant planning permission was unlawful because the EIA for the project failed to assess the effect of scope 3 emissions resulting from the eventual combustion of oil produced by the new wells. Delivering the majority judgment, Lord Leggatt emphasized that scope 3 emissions are an inevitable consequence of crude oil production. The case had proceeded on the basis of an agreed fact that all crude oil produced from the project would be combusted, which he concluded resulted in the scope 3 emissions being a relevant effect which was required to be considered in the EIA. The Supreme Court noted that, while scope 3 emissions are required to be considered in the EIA, this need not preclude the grant of permission. Instead, the obligation to consider scope 3 effects in EIAs, where relevant, ensures that the decision-making process is informed by a comprehensive understanding of a project’s impact on the environment. The leading judgment cited the decision of the Oslo District Court in Greenpeace Nordic v The State of Norway, which also decided that the EIA in question should have considered scope 3 emissions.",

Until 2019, the Louvre Museum’s activity reports included TotalEnergies in its list of sponsors. In addition, TotalEnergies was one of the founding members of the 2004 Louvre Business Circle, which brings together corporate sponsors.

This right is crucial to understand the decision-making processes and justifications of public policy decisions. While Quai Branly Museum has responded favorably and communicated all the requested partnership agreements signed since January 2015, the Louvre Museum had remained silent. Greenpeace filed a petition for abuse of power against the Louvre Museum for its implicit refusal to disclose administrative documents. \r\n\r\nOn January 6, 2022, the French commission on access to administrative documents (Commission d'accès aux documents administratifs) issued a favorable decision for Greenpeace.

These groups filed proceedings in the High Court of South Africa to challenge the government’s decision to include 1,500 MW of new coal-fired power in the Integrated Resource Plan of 2019. The applicants named the Minister of Mineral Resources and Energy, the National Energy Regulator of South Africa (NERSA), the Minister of Forestry, Fisheries and the Environment, and the President as respondents.\r\n\r\nThe applicants argued that the government’s decision violated multiple constitutional rights, including the right to a healthy environment (section 24), the best interests of children (section 28), and the rights to life, dignity, and equality. They contended that coal-fired power, a major contributor to climate change and environmental degradation, posed severe risks to public health, particularly for children and future generations. Expert evidence was presented to demonstrate the harmful effects of coal emissions on health, livelihoods, and food security, as well as the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of cleaner, renewable energy alternatives. The applicants also criticized the decision-making process for failing to: (i) conduct specific impact assessments on children’s rights, (ii) consider cleaner coal technologies or renewable energy options, and (iii) ensure public participation, particularly from youth and vulnerable communities. An interlocutory application was filed in 2022 to compel the government to provide complete records of the decision, which the court granted on December 9, 2022. The Minister of Electricity was added as a fifth respondent on April 17, 2024.\r\n\r\nIn a judgment handed down on December 4, 2024, Judge Cornelius van der Westhuizen ruled that the government’s plan to procure 1,500 MW of new coal-fired power was unconstitutional, unlawful, and invalid.

The court noted that the government’s Rule 53 record provided no evidence of adequate consideration of the environmental and health impacts of coal power, particularly on children. The respondents’ argument that South Africa’s energy crisis justified the procurement of coal-fired power was dismissed, as the court found no evidence supporting the necessity of coal over renewable alternatives.

The Declaration is a three page document that declares “an urgent need for responsive leadership and a holistic approach to climate change.” It calls on the government of New Zealand to prioritize an ambitious transition plan, underpinned by an assessment of the country’s “economic vulnerabilities and opportunities”. It commits the Council to develop and implement ambitious action plans that reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and support resilience within communities, as well as work with the central government to deliver on national emissions reduction targets. \r\n\r\nOn June 28, 2019, Hauraki Coromandel Climate Action Incorporated (HCCA), an NGO, applied for judicial review of the Council’s decision. The Council applied to strike out the claim. On March 20, 2020, Judge Gault issued a judgement that declined to strike out the claim, “holding it was arguable the Council decision is amenable to judicial review and the claim is not so clearly untenable that it cannot possibly succeed.\"\r\n\r\nOn August 31, 2020, the High Court made a further determination that the claim was justiciable, citing <a href=\"https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/thomson-v-minister-for-climate-change-issues/\">Thomson v Minister for Climate Change Issues</a>, and stating that “the existence of a policy dimension to a decision does not immune it from judicial review” but “rather, the reverse.” The Council’s decision holds strong public interest. Therefore, given the nature, effects, including potential legal implications, and the decision's significance, it is reviewable by the Court. \r\n\r\nThe High Court accepted the expert evidence that anthropogenic climate change is occurring and cited the Supreme Court’s decision in the Netherlands (<a href=\"https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/urgenda-foundation-v-kingdom-of-the-netherlands/\">Urgenda Foundation v.

Only if a council had taken sound and sensible mitigation steps that went far beyond the Declaration might it be reasonable for them not to sign it. The Mayor was precluded from taking an objective perspective on the matter by her own prejudices.\"\r\n\r\nThe Defendants submitted that the Council’s decision was the most reasonable it could make, given the Council’s lack of capacity to compel the Mayor’s signature. It was also reasonable for the Council to “decline to make a decision about its future policy on climate change response to Council Peters’ motion,” as the considerations had not been properly analyzed by the Council. Furthermore, while the Declaration may create reviewable expectations, an application based on that ground would be unlikely to succeed because the commitments stated in the Declaration are very general. \r\n\r\nHowever, the Court accepted the Claimant's argument that the intensity of review of decisions about climate change by public decision-makers is similar to that for fundamental human rights and that heightened scrutiny is deserved in this case. The reasons for the decision indicated the need for further analysis and consideration of the issue. \r\n\r\nAs such, the Court has ordered the following remedies: (i) It has declared that the Council’s decision was inconsistent with the requirements of the Local Government Act 2002 and the Council’s Significance and Engagement Policy; (ii) It has directed the Council to reconsider and determine, consistently with the requirements of the Local Government Act 2002, the Council’s Significance and Engagement Policy, and the Court’s judgement, whether or not to approve the Mayor signing the Declaration. The Court has awarded costs to HCCA.\r\n",

      "summary": "At the end of May 2021, three Danish NGOs filed a suit against Danish Crown, the EU’s largest pork producer, claiming that the company is misleading consumers through its campaign that claims its pork production is “climate controlled” and that the pork is “more climate friendly than you would think.” Danish Crown is a cooperative owned by over 6,000 Danish farmers. It has committed to reducing its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 50% by 2030. \r\n\r\nAccording to media reports, the claimants allege that Danish Crown is misrepresenting its climate footprint, and is in violation of the Marketing Act, which the Danish Crown refutes. It states that because the pigs have “grown up on farms with a clear strategy for reducing CO2 emissions,” Danish Crown is not misleading consumers. In its 2020-2021 Annual Report published in November 2021, Danish Crown mentions the lawsuit and that it is cooperating with authorities. \r\n\r\nIn January 2022, the court proceedings began in the Western High Court. The court has found that the case is “of a principle nature and has a general signification for the application of and development of the law.”  The Danish Crown had argued to have the case heard in the Maritime and Commercial Court, which the court has denied. The case will proceed in the High Court.  \r\n\r\nOn March 1, 2024, the High Court ruled that the use of the term 'climate-friendly' is not in violation of the Market Practices Act, but 'climate-controlled pork' was.

      "type": "case",
      "count": 1,
      "summary": "On December 20, 2019, the Italian Competition Authority (AGCM) imposed a five million euro fine—the maximum allowable penalty—on ENI, a major Italian oil and gas company, for engaging in \"unfair commercial practices regarding environmental claims.\" The AGCM found that ENI’s advertising for its Diesel+ fuel misled consumers by associating the product with “green” attributes that were not fully representative of the fuel’s environmental impact. Specifically, the AGCM held that environmental claims in advertising should (i) clearly and accurately reflect the product's environmental benefits, (ii) be supported by scientific evidence, and (iii) be conveyed without misleading omissions.\r\n\r\nENI’s Diesel+ advertising campaign prominently used a “green” logo alongside the product name, which, according to the AGCM, implied that the environmental benefits applied to the fuel as a whole, when in reality, they were limited to only one component. The Authority determined that this campaign spread “false and omissive information” about Diesel+’s environmental impact, creating a misleading impression of reduced greenhouse gas emissions. As a result, the AGCM concluded that ENI’s campaign constituted an “unfair commercial practice” in violation of Articles 21 and 22 of the Italian Consumer Code, which protect consumers from misleading advertising.\r\n\r\nENI appealed the decision to the Regional Administrative Court of Lazio, which upheld the AGCM's ruling. However, on April 23, 2024, Italy's highest administrative court, the Consiglio di Stato, overturned this decision in ENI’s favor. The Consiglio di Stato found that ENI’s advertising did not constitute an unfair commercial practice and ruled the AGCM’s claims unfounded. The court emphasized that “green” claims could be applied to products like diesel fuel, which, despite remaining polluting, could offer relatively lower environmental impacts compared to other products. The court noted that such claims were permissible provided they included “supporting claims”—additional messages or visuals clarifying the product’s limited environmental benefits. This ruling thus established that, within Italy’s regulatory framework, the use of green claims was acceptable for inherently polluting products, provided the claims were contextualized and not misleading in their presentation.",

      "count": 1,
      "summary": "In 2007, the European Union (EU) legislature established a harmonized framework for the approval of motor vehicles to facilitate their registration, sale, and entry into service in the EU. Within this framework, the European Commission adopted Regulation 2016/646 to set up a procedure for testing the real driving emissions of certain motor vehicles to better reflect the emissions measured on the road. This Regulation was supplemented by Commission Regulation 2016/646, which establishes limits for emissions not to be exceeded during tests.\r\n\r\nOn June 26, June 29, and July 16, 2016, respectively, the City of Paris, the City of Brussels, and the Municipality of Madrid brought an action before the General Court to annul Regulation 2016/646. The cities argued that the regulation would prevent them from imposing restrictions on the circulation of passenger vehicles in relation to their air pollutant emissions. The Commission raised the objection that the contested regulation was not of direct concern to the applicants within the meaning of the fourth paragraph of article 263 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU (TFEU). \r\n\r\nIn its judgment of December 13, 2018, the General Court partially upheld the actions and held that the contested regulation was of direct concern to the applicants. The General Court considered the regulation a regulatory act which does not entail implementing measures and which directly affects the cities’ powers to regulate the circulation of motor vehicles. On February 23, 2019, the Commission appealed to the European Court of Justice.\r\n\r\nOn January 13, 2022, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) set aside the judgement of the General Court, in particular the interpretation by the General Court of Directive 2007/46. The ECJ clarified that for the applicants to be directly concerned by the regulation (and therefore, for the action to be admissible), two conditions must be met. First, the contested measure must directly affect the legal situation of the applicant. Secondly, it must leave no discretion to the entity entrusted with the implementation. The ECJ held that the General Court erred when it stated that the cities were prevented from exercising their powers to regulate the circulation of passenger vehicles to reduce pollution. \r\n\r\nThe disagreement between the General Court and the ECJ revolved around article 4, paragraph 3, second subparagraph of Directive 2007/46, which mentions that member states “shall not prohibit, restrict or impede the registration, sale, entry into service or circulation on the road of vehicles, […] if they satisfy the requirements of the [Directive].” The General Court inferred from the inclusion of the words ‘circulation on the road’ that the Directive restricted the regulatory powers of the local governments to adopt traffic restrictions for vehicles. As a result, the Directive and its implementing acts directly affect the legal position of the cities. \r\n\r\nThe ECJ, however, ruled that the negative obligation in the second subparagraph of article 4, paragraph 3 must be read together with the first subparagraph. The first subparagraph gives the member states a positive obligation to “register or permit the sale or entry into service only of such vehicles, components and separate technical units as satisfy the requirements of this Directive,” without any mention of circulation on the road. As the two subparagraphs are complementary, the ECJ concluded that the General Court erred when it gave the second subparagraph a broader meaning. As a consequence, the General Court also erred when it derived from this that the cities were directly affected, and thus directly concerned, by the contested Regulation. \r\n\r\nThe ECJ also mentioned that the obligations Directive 2007/46 imposes on Member States only concern placing motor vehicles on the market and not their subsequent use. Moreover, the cities are not liable to infringe on Directive 2007/46 (read together with Commission Regulation 2016/646) solely by adopting environmental protection legislation to limit the local circulation of certain vehicles. Through its judgment, the ECJ clarified that local governments do not violate the EU framework for testing real driving emissions when they adopt low-emission zones.",

The 84 participants were subject to administrative proceedings and a fine of 750 euros each (for a total sum of 88,500 euros). In addition, seven of them, aged 20 to 43, were facing up to five years in prison and 18,000 euros in fines. Two of them were also subject to a complaint related to the destruction of a fence to let the other protestors in. The prosecutor requested sentences of one to three months suspended jail term (i.e., the sentence will be part of their criminal record but they will not serve any jail term unless they do a similar act within that period). \r\n\r\nIn response to the prosecution, the activists argued they were acting according to their right to freedom of expression. Furthermore, they claimed that the seriousness of climate change meant they were acting in a state of necessity, which justifies an offense when necessary to warn of a future danger. In addition, they argued that they had tried protests and petitions before but that these did not alter the government’s decision to build an additional terminal. In contrast, the government announced that it would abandon the T4 project after their climate action. \r\n\r\nOn November 12th, 2021, the court acquitted the activists. The court found that the activists acted to raise awareness about the adverse effects of climate change. As such, the measures were justified as a “state of necessity.” The court also acquitted the activists for refusing to allow a police officer to take their DNA. The court further reclassified the offenses from serious damage to light damage and fined two of the defendants to 500 euros each for cutting the fence around the airport. ",

      "summary": "On June 4, 2019, the Ministry of Energy, and the energy companies involved in decarbonization process, signed an Agreement on the phase-out of coal-fired thermoelectric power plants. Chile's Energy Sector Decarbonization Plan contains a gradual closure of existing coal-fired power plants at the national level. Coal power plants accounted for 36.7% of energy generation in 2019 and for 25% of greenhouse gas emissions. Chile’s goal is to reach carbon neutrality by 2005. As part of the decarbonization agreement, the government launched the process to elaborate a Just Energy Transition Strategy. \r\n\r\nWithin this process, they initiated the discussion to generate local action plans for communities affected by coal-fired power plants. These local action plans may make it possible to diagnose the existing social, productive, environmental and territorial needs to generate actions resulting from participatory processes, with clear goals, indicators, deadlines and responsible parties. The plan seeks to reintegrate affected workers into the workforce. Furthermore, it creates mechanisms to safeguard the rights of workers during the transition process. However, on December 26, 2020, the Ministry of Energy issued the Supreme Decree No. 42, which ordered the implementation of a plan that ensures the reinsertion or reconversion of workers into the labor market without consulting with workers affected by the decarbonization plan.\r\n\r\nOn January 25, 2021, the three union workers brought a case against the Ministry of Energy. The plaintiffs argued that they were not consulted in the energy decarbonization agreements made between the government and the energy companies. This was in violation of their constitutional guarantees (Art. 19), which recognize the right to equality before the law, freedom of labor, freedom of association, and property rights\r\n\r\nOn March 26, 2021, the Court of Appeals of Antofagasta rejected the workers’ claims on procedural grounds (Case Rol Nº 318-2021). The Court found that the matter in question was beyond its competence, as it involved the exercise of powers belonging to the executive branch. It added that the Ministry of Energy does not have any labor relationship with the Ministry of Energy but rather with the companies in the energy sector. \r\n\r\nOn August 9, 2021, the Chilean Supreme Court (Case No. 25. 530-2021) overruled the decision of the Court of Appeals and upheld the plaintiffs’ appeal. The ruling considered the closure of coal-fired plants as a part of Chile's Energy Sector Decarbonization Plan to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. The decision specifies that in this context, the agreements adopted by the State of Chile to achieve carbon neutrality require the performance of a just transition strategy both for the workers harmed by the loss of their direct and indirect source of employment and for the communities affected by the loss of services linked to the development of the declining thermoelectric activity, allowing the transition to an environmentally sustainable economy. The lack of consultation was in violation of the government’s obligation to ensure a just transition. The ruling ordered the government authorities to implement a plan for the reinsertion into the labor market of workers affected by the decarbonization process, consulting them in that process, and adopting the control measures to ensure compliance.\r\n\r\nIn 2021, the Chilean government released a Just Transition Strategy to demonstrate compliance with the court decision. In this plan, they established plans for the remediation of sites affected by coal plant operations, the replacement of coal with renewable energy sources, the expansion of national transmission infrastructure, and an inclusive governance structure that involves local stakeholders.

Their purpose was to cause disruption in order to draw attention to the contribution of air travel to climate change. The group included James Hugh Brown, a former Paralympic champion, who glued himself to the top of a commercial passenger aircraft. For this, he was convicted by the Crown Court for public nuisance and imprisoned for 12 months. He appealed both conviction and sentence.\r\n\r\nOn January 14, 2022, the Court of Appeal gave judgment, dismissing the appeal against conviction but allowing the appeal against sentence and substituting a four-month term of imprisonment. On his appeal against conviction, Mr Brown agued the court below should have stayed the prosecution for the common law offense of public nuisance (which has a maximum penalty of life imprisonment) as an abuse of process. This was because alternative statutory offenses were available, such as aggravated trespass (which has a maximum penalty of three months). Failure to stay, argued Mr Brown, amounted to a breach of his human rights (freedom of thought, conscience and religion; freedom of expression; and freedom of assembly and association). Rejecting these arguments, the Court held that the concept of abuse of process in a criminal case is the creature of domestic law and does not turn on any issue under the European Convention on Human Rights or the Human Rights Act 1998. On his appeal against sentence, Mr Brown argued the 12 months imprisonment was too long given the offense was committed in the course of protest. Instead, only a fine should have been imposed. The Court considered jurisprudence from the European Court of Human Rights on when a custodial sentence might be appropriate in the context of peaceful protest amounting to public nuisance. It agreed with the court below that Mr Brown’s offending passed the custody threshold. However, taking account his conduct (including that this was a peaceful protest), his previous convictions and his disability it held the 12 month sentence was manifestly excessive, and substituted a four-month sentence.",

They also requested the case to be treated under the expenditure procedure pursuant to Article 41 of the Rules of the Court.\r\n\r\nThe application listed three main complaints: Switzerland's inadequate climate policies violate the women's right life and health under Articles 2 and 8 of the ECHR; the Swiss Federal Supreme Court's rejected their case on arbitrary grounds, in violation of the right to a fair trial under Article 6; and the Swiss authorities and courts did not deal with the content of their complaints, in violation of the right to an effective remedy in Article 13.\r\n\r\nThe ECtHR preliminary accepted the case and communicated it to the Swiss government on March 25, 2021. The ECtHR gave the case priority status and called on Switzerland to submit a response by July 16, 2021, which was timely filed.\r\n\r\nOn September 21, 2021, the International Commission of Jurists (ICJ) and the Swiss Section of the ICJ submitted a third-party intervention providing observations on the effects of climate change on the right to life and the right to respect for private and family life and for the home and the positive obligations of States resulting from these rights, in light of principles of international environmental law, among other issues. The European Network of National Human Rights Institutions (ENNHR) also submitted a third-party intervention.\r\n\r\nOn October 13, 2021, the petitioner replied to the Swiss government's response to the ECtHR, arguing that the Swiss government failed to protect the Applicants' rights to life and private life under Arts. 2 and 8 ECHR, by failing to adopt the necessary legislative and administrative framework to do its share to prevent a global temperature increase of more than 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.\r\n\r\nOn April 26, 2022, the Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights relinquished jurisdiction in favor of the Grand Chamber of the Court. The case is now going to be examined by the ECtHR's Grand Chamber of 17 judges on account of the fact that the case raises a serious question affecting the interpretation of the Convention (Art 30 ECHR). \r\n\r\nOn December 2, 2022, the applicants submitted a petition highlighting observations on the facts, admissibility and the merits. On December 5, 2022, several organizations, including the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law, submitted third party interventions to the case. Hearings were held in March 2023. \r\n\r\nOn April 9, 2024, the European Court found a violation of the right to respect for private and family life (Article 8) and access to court (Article 6 § 1). The Court found that Article 8 of the Convention encompasses a right to effective protection by the State authorities from the serious adverse effects of climate change on lives, health, well-being and quality of life. The Court found that Switzerland failed to comply with its positive obligations under the Convention concerning climate change, with critical gaps in establishing a relevant domestic regulatory framework, including through a carbon budget or national GHG emissions limitations. Switzerland had also failed to meet its past GHG emission reduction targets.\r\n\r\nWhile recognizing that national authorities enjoy wide discretion concerning the implementation of legislation and measures, the Court held that the Swiss authorities had not acted in time and in an appropriate way to devise, develop, and implement relevant legislation and measures in this case. In addition, the Court found that Article 6 § 1 of the Convention applied to the applicant association’s complaint concerning effective implementation of the mitigation measures under existing domestic law.\r\n\r\nOn March 6, 2025, the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe decided that Switzerland is not yet complying with the requirements of the ECtHR judgment in the case of the KlimaSeniorinnen. Switzerland has yet to prove that it is doing enough to align its policy with a maximum global warming limit of 1.5°C.  Specifically, the CMDH  \"invited also the authorities to further demonstrate that the methodology used to devise, develop and implement the relevant legislative and administrative framework responds to the Convention requirements as detailed by the Court and relies on a quantification, through a carbon budget or otherwise, of national greenhouse gas emissions limitations\"",

      "summary": "On January 12, 2022, Friends of the Earth (FoE) filed a claim for judicial review against the SoS, in relation to the Net Zero Strategy (“NZS”)  and the Heat and Buildings Strategy (HBS; the Government’s strategy to decarbonize homes and buildings) arguing that both strategies were unlawfully adopted. The NZS is the Government’s economy-wide decarbonization strategy. The CCA was the first piece of legislation anywhere in the world to set domestically enforceable carbon reduction targets. Sections 13 and 14 of the CCA require the SoS to produce policies which will enable upcoming carbon budgets set under the CCA to be met (s.13), and to report on those policies to parliament (s.14). \r\n\r\nThe environmental legal charity, ClientEarth, and the NGO, Good Law Project (“GLP”), filed separate judicial review challenges to the NZS in the week commencing 17 January 2022, also in relation to the CCA. In relation to the NZS, all three claimants argued that the SoS breached sections 13 and 14 of the CCA. FoE also argued that the SoS breached section 149 of the Equality Act 2010 through failing to consider the impact of the HBS on people with protected characteristics. Research shows that people with certain protected characteristics under the Equality Act 2010, such as people of colour, people with disabilities and older people, are disproportionately impacted by issues such as energy poverty. GLP also brought a separate ground in relation to human rights, under s.3 of the Human Rights Act 1998 (HRA). They argued that s.13 and s.14 of the CCA had not been interpreted in way that is compatible with the Government’s human rights obligations, including Article 8 (right to private and family life).\r\n\r\nThe three claimants all received permission to proceed on all grounds on March 1, 2022. The court found that the cases all had realistic prospects of success, and merited a full substantive hearing. On April 7, 2022 the SoS conceded on FoE’s HBS ground, confirming that he had breached his public sector equality duty and was undertaking an equality impact assessment of the HBS (FoE had identified through an Environmental Information Request, that he had not done one previously). The substantive hearing for the three cases took place on 8 and 9 June 2022 before Mr Justice Holgate at the High Court. Following this, a separate hearing was listed on July 15, 2022 in relation to the evidence on the distinction between the quantified impacts of the policies in the NZS, and the emissions reduction delivery pathway. The latter, which was based on modelling for the potential for each sector across the economy to decarbonise, was included in the NZS but the former was not.\r\n\r\nFollowing legal challenges brought by (1) Friends of the Earth, (2) ClientEarth and (3) Good Law Project and Joanna Wheatley, the High Court ruled on 18 July 18, 2022 that the Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (Kwasi Kwarteng; the “SoS”) breached s.13 and s.14 of the Climate Change Act 2008 (“CCA”) when he adopted the NZS on 19 October 2021. Holgate J found that the NZS had been unlawfully adopted as:\r\n1.\tThe Minister had legally insufficient information before him to adopt the NZS (breach of s.13 of the CCA). For example, whilst he had been informed that the quantified policies in the NZS added up to c.95% of the emissions reductions needed to meet the sixth carbon budget (CB6; set under the CCA, and covering the period 2033-2037), he had not been provided with the breakdown of the contributions of the individual policies, and it had not been explained to him how the 5% shortfall would be made up. This mean that he was not able to properly understand the risk to the delivery of the policies in the NZS. Risk to delivery was an obviously material consideration.\r\n2.\tThe NZS itself lacked vital information which meant that Parliament and the public were unable to properly scrutinize it (breach of s.14 of the CCA). For example, Parliament was not aware of the 5% shortfall for meeting CB6. The NZS should have included quantified policies (i.e. setting out what their individual emissions reductions were estimated to be), in order for Parliament to be able to scrutinize risk to delivery. The judgment placed “considerable weight” on the views of the Committee on Climate Change, the independent expert body under the CCA, which had advised the Government that the NZS should include quantified policies. \r\nGLP’s separate ground relating to the HRA was not successful; Holgate J concluded that it was too ambitious and did not accord with established principles. \r\n\r\nThe Government is not pursuing an appeal and so must comply with the High Court’s order, under which it must produce a report which is compliant with s.14 of the CCA by no later than March 31, 2023.\r\n\r\nA separate claim, unrelated to the cases issued by FoE, ClientEarth and GLP’s claims was brought by two claimants, Adaeze Aghaji and Peter Garforth, against the Government’s NZS alleging that the proposals and policies set out are insufficient to meet the UK’s sixth carbon budget. The claimants filed for judicial review in late March 2022 and were granted permission to proceed on the 25 May 2022. However, the application was stayed pending the outcome of the claims brought by FoE, ClientEarth and GLP.",

      "summary": "Four protesters were charged with trespass for the occupation of an offshore oil platform. The protesters pled guilty prior to hearing. The protesters argued that the action was peaceful, and genuinely motivated by a belief, founded on a basis of scientific consensus, as to the nature and effects of climate change, and therefore necessary to respond to the threat of harm. \r\n\r\nOn November 13, 2020, the judge gave the sentencing. The judge accepted that anthropogenic climate change and its effects are undeniable, and that there is a right to freedom of expression. The judge accepted that without activism, change may be too late. However, she said, activism does not necessarily mean civil disobedience, and peaceful civil disobedience cannot be condoned where it infringes the genuine existing rights of another. In this case, there was an obligation not to interfere with a corporation carrying out its rights, where current New Zealand laws permit exploration and extraction of fossil fuels. The protesters should have sought law reform, and to educate the public without breaching the law. Nonetheless, the protesters' genuine belief in the correctness of their course, their early guilty pleas, and their otherwise good character were considered to be personal mitigating features. Aggravating features were the duration of the offending and the financial loss to the complainant. The protesters were convicted and discharged without penalty. The judge ordered forfeiture of the steel tubes used in the action, but not of the climbing equipment belonging to one of the protesters, because it was essential to his only means of income.",

Specifically, the complaint highlights that ENI has committed to net zero emissions by 2050, but its actions run contrary to this goal. For example, ENI plans to increase its oil production by 4% each year until at least 2024, and is proposing to rely on large amounts of negative emissions technology (7 million tonnes of CO2 stocked each year by 2030). The complaint alleges that ENI has not complied with the OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises due to: (i) the fact that the company's strategic plan does not foresee a sufficient cut in GHG emissions in the coming years; (ii) the lack of a climate impact assessment of the company's activities; (iii) the absence of transparent and adequate information; and (iv) the failure to develop a plan for risk prevention and mitigation. As the National Contact Point is a non-judicial grievance mechanism, the applicants have requested mediation with ENI.

      "count": 1,
      "summary": "On September 27, 2017, 124 citizens in Sendai instituted a lawsuit against the Sendai Power Station seeking an injunction to the operation of the power plant. The plaintiffs argued that the operation of the Sendai Power Station violated (i) their personal rights to life, health, and bodily integrity (Jinkaku-ken) due to the health damage caused by the emission of environmental pollutants, (ii) their personal rights to life, health, and bodily integrity due to climate change, and (iii) the right to maintain biodiversity due to the emission of hazardous substances. Firstly, the plaintiffs argued that the emissions of pollutants, such as SOx and NOx, caused significant health damage by increasing the risks of various illnesses. Secondly, the plaintiffs argued that their personal rights were violated as greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions would worsen climate change, which causes extreme events, such as heat waves and heavy rains. To support this argument, they stated that the current use of coal-fired power plants was incompatible with the GHG emissions reduction targets in Japan and was also an obstacle to the achievement of the goals of the Paris Agreement. Thirdly, the plaintiffs claimed that environmental rights, including the right to maintain biodiversity, should be recognized based on Article 13 of the Constitution. \r\n\r\nThose three arguments are later modified to the tort claims based on the right to a peaceful life, which they claimed was violated by environmental pollution, personal rights concerning life and bodily integrity, which they claimed were violated by climate change, and the right to maintain biodiversity. During the proceedings, the right to maintain biodiversity was excluded from the points of dispute by the parties based on the Court’s determination that the right to maintain biodiversity is not recognized under Japanese civil law. Similarly, the plaintiffs indicated in the 10th preparatory document that they withdrew their claim based on the personal rights to life and bodily integrity, and thus, the second argument related to climate change was removed from the points of dispute.\r\n\r\nOn October 28, 2020, the Sendai District Court delivered a judgment, which solely discussed the right to a peaceful life focusing on environmental pollution. The Court rejected the plaintiffs’ claim by saying that neither the nature nor the level of environmental pollution was serious and that the evidence provided by the plaintiffs lacked objectivity and credibility. The court did not rule on GHG emissions because they were part of the second argument, which were modified before the ruling. The Court further mentioned that the business operator had social accountability to do its best to relieve the citizens’ concerns about environmental pollution.\r\n\r\nOn December 22, 2020, one citizen filed an appeal. In the statement of appeal, the appellant claimed that the district court has made 5 errors. Firstly, he claimed that the court misinterpreted the initial complaint by equating the mental distress with the threat to life and bodily integrity, which was claimed by the plaintiffs. Secondly, he claimed that the court had misunderstood the scientific concepts and terms and thus failed to recognize the risks based on the scientific evidence. Thirdly, he claimed that the court should still have considered the issues of global warming and GHG emissions either as factors to counteract the public necessity of the power plant or as aggravating factors of the tort even if the violation of the plaintiffs’ rights by global warming was not discussed since the CO2 emission by the power plant was against the generally accepted idea in the modern society and national carbon neutral policies. Fourthly, he claimed that the court misinterpreted the expert’s opinion concerning the concentration of PM 2.5 and thus failed to recognize the health risks. Lastly, he claimed that the court ignored the precedents and academic theories related to personal rights and air pollution. He argued that there was no public necessity for a new power plant and the protection of personal rights should be prioritized.\r\n\r\nOn April 27, 2021, Sendai High Court issued a judgment on the appeal. The parties did not dispute that the power plant could cause the emission of air pollutants. Thus, the issue discussed was whether the threat of damage to the appellant’s life and bodily integrity by the health impact due to the exposure to the air pollutants could be recognized as a violation of personal rights (either the physical rights or the right to a peaceful life) leading to the illegality of the operation of the power plant. The court ruled that while it could not deny that there was abstract danger, there was no sufficient evidence to recognize concrete danger to the appellant’s health. The amounts of emissions of PM 2.5 and NOx are within the normal range and the amounts of other pollutants, including mercury, were all lower than the environmental standards. The court believes that there is no indication that air pollution has worsened after the power plant started operating. As for the public necessity, the presence of surplus at one moment does not mean that there was no public necessity for the power plant since power demand and supply are easily influenced by various circumstances. Moreover, considering the current energy policy, usability and public nature of the power plant concerned cannot be denied while there is discussion and governmental policies to prevent global warming, such as ‘2050 Carbon-Neutral’. Further, the court adds that no concrete danger to global warming nor biodiversity is recognizable. The court rejected the appeal and supported the first instance judgment. The court cannot find concrete danger, which exceeds the socially acceptable upper limits, to health when considering the nature and level of damage, the social usability, public nature, and preventive measures.

      "summary": "A group of citizens filed a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of (among others) articles 20 and 173 of Law 1753 of 2015. These articles included rules for allowing mining activities in sensitive, high-altitude ecosystems known as ‘páramos’ and gave the Colombian mining authority the ‘indefinite’ power to delimit strategic areas for mining exploitation. Plaintiffs argued that páramos play a vital role in mitigating climate change, since they are natural carbon sinks and provide 70% of Colombian water supply. Claimants asserted that allowing mining activities in these areas will significantly impact Colombia’s climate change mitigation capacity, which can have transboundary impacts in neighboring countries, such as Ecuador and Venezuela. Plaintiffs contended that this Law lowered the previously existing duty of protection standard by allowing mining authorities to decide which páramo areas can host mining activities. In doing that, they argued the Colombian government violated its own constitutional provisions, as well as the obligations derived from the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.\r\n  \r\nCertain aspects of Law 1753’s constitutionality had been analyzed in a separate case in response similar arguments. Hence, Colombia’s Constitutional Court declared res judicata and reiterated its previous Decision C-035/16 striking down parts of articles 20 and 173 of Law 1753 of 2015, which authorize the Colombian government to designate certain projects as being in the national interest and authorize projects in páramos received prior to certain dates. \r\n\r\nRegarding new arguments not analyzed in Decision C-035/16, the Constitutional Court struck down provisions of Law 1753 that allowed environmental authorities to designate mining areas without a temporal limit (among other provisions). The Court found the provision of an ‘indefinite’ power to delimit strategic mining areas violated the right to a healthy environment and enjoyment of natural resources for both present and future generations. The Court underscored the incompatibility of granting ‘indefinite’ powers to administrative authorities with the right to a healthy environment, since these delimited mining areas are likely to be selected for exploitation, which in turn could cause environmental harms to these sensitive and ecologically important areas.",

The plaintiff argued that mining permits issued in the Combeima and Cocora rivers violated collective rights since these rivers have been designated areas of special environmental importance. The plaintiff invoked a potential damage to water quality and availability in relation to the constitutional right to a healthy environment (articles 79 and 80 of the Colombian Constitution). \r\n\r\nThe court of first instance, the Administrative Tribunal, declared the Combeima, Cocora, and Coello rivers as subject of rights. However, in September 2020, during the appeal process, the Council of State (hereinafter ‘the Court’) reversed this declaration. The Court reasoned that the <a href=\"https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/atrato-river-decision-t-622-16-of-november-10-2016/\">Atrato River case</a> precedent was not applicable in this case since the cases differ in factual elements and legal arguments. Particularly, the Court underscored that, in this case, the mining activities have yet to be executed, whereas, in the Atrato River case, there was sufficient evidence of damage caused by mining activities.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the Court found that the mining titles in this case had the potential to cause environmental damage to the Combeima and Cocora rivers. The Court invoked climate change as a main driver of water scarcity. The Court reasoned that environmental and mining authorities must take climate change into consideration when issuing environmental permits, as climate change relates to their obligation to prevent disasters. Therefore, the Court ordered the protection of the right to a healthy environment and halted mining activities in the Combeima and Cocora rivers. The Court conditioned the possibility of resuming activities on finding an alternative method of exploration that does not affect the Combeima and Cocora rivers. In case an alternative is not found, mining titles would lose their effect. The environmental authority was ordered to conduct visits to evaluate how the activities were being developed.",

      "summary": "On November 29, 2021, four environmental and human rights organizations (Sustaining the Wild Coast NPC, Mashona Dlamini, Dwesa-Cwebe Communal Property Association and four others) filed an application in the High Court of South Africa (Eastern Cape Division, Grahamstown) against respondents Minister of Mineral Resources and Energy, Minister of Environment, Forestry and Fisheries, Shell and Impact Africa. The application sought an interdict prohibiting the respondents from proceeding with the seismic survey off the eastern coast of South Africa from 2021-2022. The seismic survey pursued by Shell and Impact Africa followed an exploration right granted on April 29, 2014. It aimed at providing imaging of the subsurface to determine whether there might be energy reserves below the sea floor. To succeed in their application, the applicants must establish: (i) at least a prima facie right (ii) a reasonable apprehension of irreparable and imminent harm of the right if the interim interdict is not granted; (iii) balance of convenience; and (iv) lack of an alternative satisfactory remedy.\r\n\r\nIn October 2021, Shell’s consultants gave notice of Shell’s intention to undertake a 3D seismic survey along the south-eastern coast. Following a public outcry, activists and affected communities approached the Eastern Cape High Court for an urgent interdict preventing Shell from proceeding with the seismic survey (Part A), pending the outcome in the present application (Part B). \r\n\r\nOn December 17, 2021, the South African High Court held a hearing on Part A (an application for an interdict where the Applicants sought an order interdicting the 3rd, 4th and 5th Respondents from proceeding with a seismic survey pending the finalization of the relief). The Court delivered the judgement on December 28, 2021. The Court found that these requirements for an interdict were satisfactorily met by the applicants. It ruled that the exploration right which was awarded without regard to the applicants’ right to meaningful consultation constitutes a prima facie violation of their right which deserves to be protected by way of an interim interdict. The Court agreed that there is reasonable apprehension of irreparable harm and imminent harm of the right as the seismic survey will promote extraction of fossil fuels and adversely impact climate change, the applicant communities’ cultural practices, ocean conservation, and the spiritual and sustainable use of ocean for healing and fishing purposes. It acknowledged the concern of the communities that seismic survey will lead to exploration without climate impact assessment, a development that is inconsistent with South Africa’s agreement at the 2021 COP26 to move away from hydrocarbon-based energy towards climate friendly renewables. While finding the balance of convenience to be in favor of the applicants, the Court reasoned that the financial loss that respondents, especially Shell and Impact Africa, are likely to suffer cannot compare with the adverse effects of infringement of the constitutional rights of the communities. Finally, the Court reasoned that the procedure contemplated under section 47 of the MPRDA and argued by the respondents as a remedy is unacceptable in that it is a time-consuming procedure. If followed, it would allow the continuous threat of infringement of the applicants’ rights. A hearing on the main application is scheduled for May 2022. \r\n\r\nShell and Impact Africa appealed the judgment of the High Court. On February 17, 2022, the judge dismissed the application. \r\n\r\nA hearing regarding Part B of the case was held on May 30-31, 2022. The High Court of South Africa (Eastern Cape Division, Makhanda) delivered the judgment on September 1, 2022. The principal question was whether the grant of an exploration right for oil and gas, resulting in the need to conduct a seismic survey along the South Coast of South Africa was lawful. The court was satisfied that the grounds for review in terms of the Promotion of Administrative Justice Act 3 of 2000 with regards to the granting of the exploration right were met and it was thus set aside, together with the right to renew.  The judgment had the effect of setting aside an exploration right that would have enabled Shell to conduct seismic surveys off South Africa’s coastline, in its search for oil and gas reserves. \r\n\r\nIn regard to the climate change impacts of the proposed seismic surveys, the Court referred to the applicants’ submissions regarding observed climate change impacts – including more unpredictable weather patterns and more extreme weather events – as well as expert testimony relating to unburnable fossil fuel reserves (i.e., most fossil fuel reserves should remain unextracted in order to limit the global temperature increase to 1.5 degrees Celsius) and the inconsistency of further oil and gas exploitation with South Africa’s international climate change commitments. The Court also found that the decision-maker had failed to take into account the considerations referred to in the Integrated Coastal Management Act 24 of 2008, which obliges the State, as the public trustee of coastal public property, to ensure that coastal public property is managed and conserved on behalf of all South Africans, including future generations.\r\n\r\nShell and Impact Africa appealed this ruling to the Supreme Court of Appeal, which issued its judgment on June 3, 2024. The Supreme Court of Appeal upheld the High Court’s judgment that the granting of the exploration right was unlawful, but suspended the order setting aside the right. In this decision, the Supreme Court of Appeal permitted Shell to pursue a third renewal application for the right. Specifically, the Supreme Court of Appeal ruled that the High Court failed to consider just and equitable relief under section 172 of the Constitution and ruled under a “far-reaching finding” establishing oil and gas exploration as inconsistent with “South Africa complying with its international climate change commitments.” \r\n\r\nOn July 2, 2024, the plaintiffs filed an appeal to the Constitutional Court, challenging the Supreme Court of Appeal’s decision to suspend the invalidation of the exploration right. The plaintiff contended that the ruling failed to uphold the right to just administrative action while allowing Shell to mend a consultation process that was already deemed constitutionally unlawful. \r\n\r\nOn August 27, 2024, the Constitutional Court granted leave to the plaintiffs while refusing Shell and Impact Africa’s application for leave. The Constitutional Court has now issued directions for further proceedings to determine if the Supreme Court of Appeal’s ruling can be considered just and equitable under the Constitution and administrative laws.\r\n",

      "summary": "In June 29, 2016, Mexico made a joint declaration with the governments of Canada and the United States pledging to reduce methane emissions by between 40 and 45% by 2025. Mexico, through the National Agency for Industrial Security and Environmental Protection in the Hydrocarbon Sector (ASEA) and the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources (SEMARNAT), adopted its national guidelines for the integral prevention and control of methane emissions from the hydrocarbon sector as a way to implement this decision. The guidelines stipulate that any entity or person regulated by ASEA, like private companies or state-owned companies in the hydrocarbon sector, must establish a program for the monitoring, prevention, and control of methane emissions for both new and existing facilities. Originally, the guidelines ordered regulated entities to draft their programs within 12 months of the beginning of operations for new facilities or those still under construction and within 12 months of the guideline’s coming into force for existing facilities. The new guidelines gave regulated entities a 3-month period to turn in their respective programs after they were drafted. However, in June 2020, the 3-month period outlined previously was expanded to 19 months. On August 7, 2020, the Mexican Center for Environmental Law (CEMDA) challenged the modification for the submission of programs by suing ASEA and SEMARNAT. \r\n\r\nOn August 23, 2021, the district court ruled that CEMDA lacked legal standing to challenge the decision since the modification did not cause a special injury to the organization. This decision has been appealed and is currently before the Third Collegiate Tribunal for Administrative Matters of the First Circuit. On March 17, 2022, the Collegiate Tribunal confirmed the district court’s ruling, deciding that CEMDA lacked legal standing to challenge the modifications. Therefore, the case was dismissed. ",

On January 21, 2019, the district judge determined that the challenge was nonjusticiable since it would transgress the relativity principle under which no amparo trial decisions can have effects beyond the parties. Greenpeace appealed this decision to the appellate Collegiate Tribunal, and the appellate court in turn decided to petition the Supreme Court to resolve the case.  \r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court granted review. In its resolution, the Court reasoned that granting relief to Greenpeace would not transgress the relativity principle since the principle could be reinterpreted to mean that parties can get relief even if the relief incidentally benefits a third party. The Court remarked that the relativity principle cannot be interpreted to be an obstacle in the protection of the environment. Notwithstanding, it affirmed the district court’s decision since the 2019 Expenditure Bill was no longer in force by the time the dispute arrived at the Supreme Court. ",

      "summary": "On December 31, 2016, the State of Zacatecas, Mexico published its 2017 Treasury Bill, Expenditure Bill and Revenue Bill. The Treasury Bill established a tax on greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) produced by stationary sources.  A corporation dedicated to beer production sued the state legislature, challenging the constitutionality of the Treasury Bill of the State of Zacatecas. Specifically, the corporation argued that the State of Zacatecas was invading the national Congress’s powers by introducing the tax. On October 31, 2017, the Second District Judge in the State of Zacatecas agreed that state authorities could not tax GHG emissions without overstepping on Congress’s power. Particularly, the judge pointed to the fact that the Mexican Constitution reserves imposition of taxes on beers to federal authorities. Thus, it declared the taxes unconstitutional. State authorities appealed the decision to the appellate Collegiate Tribunal, and the Collegiate Tribunal sent the case to the Supreme Court for review. \r\n\r\nOn February 20, 2020, the Supreme Court concluded that States were not prevented from implementing taxes on GHG emissions since, as a general rule, Federal and State authorities have joint powers to establish taxes unless the Mexican Constitution reserves a specific area to the federation. The Court noted that the tax on GHG emissions under analysis was not a tax on beer production but rather on the emission, deposition, or storage of substances in the atmosphere. The Court also noted that the State had acted pursuant to its responsibilities under Mexico’s General Law on Ecologic Equilibrium and Environment Protection and the General Law on Climate Change.\r\n \r\nResponding to other arguments from the corporation, the Court noted that the tax intended to force polluters to internalize the costs of their GHG emitting activities, and this was a valid implementation of the “polluter pays principle.”  The Court also dismissed the corporation’s argument that the UNFCCC only called developed countries to take action on GHG emissions. In this sense, the Court noted that Mexican authorities have a duty to address the effects of climate change. Finally, the Court dismissed the argument that the tax was arbitrary since it only applied to GHG emissions and not to other gas emissions that also pollute the atmosphere. To do so, the Court carried out a proportionality analysis to conclude that the distinction made by the State was justified. ",

The case argues that Total’s flagship advertising campaign accompanying its ‘rebrand’ to TotalEnergies misled French consumers, because (i) Total’s claims to be aiming for ‘net zero’ by 2050 and to becoming a major player in the energy transition are false and (ii) the advertising claims promoting the environmental virtues and transition role of gas and biofuels are misleading.\r\n\r\nThe action is brought on the basis of Articles L.121-1 and ff. of the French Consumer Code (which implement EU Unfair Commercial Practices Directive), article 1240 of the French Civil Code, and article L. 142-2 of the Environment Code.\r\n \r\nThe NGOs argue that they have standing to pursue the defendants for unfair commercial practices on the basis of article L. 142-2 of the Environment Code, which sets forth that « the approved organizations referred to in Article L. 141-2 may exercise the rights granted to civil parties in respect of acts directly or indirectly prejudicial to the collective interests that they are intended to defend and constituting an infringement of the legislative provisions relating to the protection of nature and the environment, (...) and having as their object (...) commercial practices and advertising that are misleading or likely to be misleading when such practices or advertising include environmental indications, as well as the texts adopted for their application ». \r\n\r\nThe NGOs argue that Total's campaign launched on May 29th, 2021 (and still ongoing), aiming to rebrand the company and its activity as environmentally sustainable, has misled and still mislead French consumers. Total’s claims on carbon neutrality by 2050 and energy transition, fossil gas and agrofuels are false. Closer scrutiny of the facts reveals that companies’ behavior is in total opposition to the requirements of the transition to carbon neutrality by 2050. Therefore, this commercial campaign entails a substantial alteration of the economic behavior of the consumer and should be considered as misleading commercial practices within the meaning of articles L.121-2 and L.121-3 of the French Consumer Code. The campaign fulfills all the conditions under articles L. 121-1 ff. of the French Consumer Code (which apply also to environmental claims) because it has a commercial aim and misleads the consumers.\r\n\r\nThe organizations claim for an injunction to stop the campaign, the publication of the decision, the compensation of the moral damages suffered by the organizations and the repayment of legal fees. \r\n\r\nThis case was brought under the French national law implementing the European Union Unfair Commercial Practices Directive.

      "summary": "In 1979, lithium was declared of national interest in Chile. Since then, only the State of Chile can manage lithium production, which maintains the status of lithium as a strategic mineral. On October 13, 2021, the Government of Chile (through the Ministry of Mining) published a call for applications to increase lithium production. This call intends to facilitate the entry of national and foreign companies in the lithium market, promoting production and supporting the development of new technologies that enable the energy transition and the fight against global warming. Lithium is a key element of the energy transition given the increased demand for rechargeable lithium-ion batteries for supplying the power and transport sectors with renewable energy. The call seeks encompass exploration, exploitation, and commercialization of a total of 400,000 tons of marketable metallic lithium, divided into 5 quotas of 80,000 tons each. \r\n\r\nOn January 10, 2022, the regional government of Atacama brought a case against the Ministry of Mining. The complaint questions the bidding process of the lithium production application, which the regional government argues was carried out without public participation and in the absence of any assessment of the activity’s potential environmental impacts on the region. The regional government argues that the project will be developed in the Atacama Salt Flats, representing a threat to its biodiversity. Atacama also points out that the project might destroy wetlands, the availability of water, which is already scarce in the area, and the destruction of cultural heritage, as it is a sector of high touristic interest. While the regional government recognizes that the call for lithium bidding responds to international pressure to guarantee an energy transition, it highlights the preliminary step to assess the impacts of the increased lithium mining. The regional authority requests that the contracts are deemed null or, in the alternative, to restart the bidding process and ensure that the regional government is properly consulted. \r\n\r\nThe Ministry of Mining argued that the bids have already been awarded to two companies and that the existing contracts refer to the exploration and exploitation of lithium. A constitutional action would not be pertinent at this stage. In the defendants’ view, the Court should analyze the alleged arbitrariness or illegality of the act at a later stage, once the act of granting the concessions has been completed. The Ministry of Mining further noted that it is up to the successful bidder to obtain the different  permits required for the operation of the lithium plant, for example environmental, water and administrative permits. \r\n\r\nOn January 14, 2022, the Court of Appeals of Copiapo granted the plaintiff’s preliminary request and suspended the contracts while the writ of protection is pending.\r\n\r\nOn July 8, 2022, the petitioners decided to withdraw the action filed, citing the resolutions made in cases No. 99-2022 and No. 8507-2022 by the Supreme Court. The Court's rulings effectively addressed the alleged constitutional violations by annulling the bidding terms of the lithium process and revoking the awarded contracts, previously granted to the companies.\r\n",

Claimants argue that the KSG's amended GHG emissions reduction paths are insufficient in light of Germany’s constitutional and international legal obligations.   \r\n\r\nThis constitutional challenge builds on the Constitutional Court’s order in <a href=\"https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/neubauer-et-al-v-germany/\">Neubauer v. Germany</a>, where the Court found in favor of a group of youths, striking down parts of the KSG as incompatible with fundamental rights for failing to set sufficient emissions reduction pathways. For the first time in its jurisprudence, the Court stated that “the fundamental rights - as intertemporal guarantees of freedom - afford protection against the greenhouse gas reduction burdens imposed by Art. 20a of the Basic Law being unilaterally offloaded onto the future.\" Consequently, the Constitutional Court ordered the federal German legislature to set clear provisions for reduction targets. In response to the decision, the federal lawmakers passed a bill approving an adapted KSG, which has been in effect since August 31, 2021. It raised the reduction target for 2030 from 55% to 65% (as compared to 1990 levels). It also updated the reduction path for the years 2031-2040, and elaborated on the legislative involvement in the determination of the individual sector budgets from 2031 onwards. Lastly, the target year for achieving carbon neutrality was brought forward from 2050 to 2045. \r\n\r\nRelying on a new factual basis and scientific updates, claimants argue that the amended KSG and its reduction targets are insufficient to protect their fundamental rights: \r\n\r\nIn August 2021, the IPCCC released the first part of its Sixth Assessment Report (AR6WGI), on the scientific basis of climate change. The report details how the 1.5°C limit may be surpassed in roughly 10 years. In the Report, the IPCC also refined previous calculations on residual budgets, directly transferrable onto Germany’s remaining budget. Beyond these developments in international climate science, claimants also invoked the Glasgow Climate Pact. In this joint final declaration of COP26, the UNFCCC’s contracting parties agreed to significantly strengthen the 1.5°C target, which includes drastic emissions reductions before the end of the decade. \r\n\r\nClaimants argue that the new reduction path continues to infringe on their fundamental rights, as it will use up large parts of Germany’s remaining CO2 budget, as determined in accordance with Article 20a of the Basic Law. Rather, claimants argue, both reduction paths, i.e., from 2021-2030, and after 2030 exceed the budget limits and put Germany way above the Paris and/or Glasgow targets. In addition, claimants argue that the risk of considerable impairments of their fundamental rights is further increased by the lack of clear obligations on, and coordinated efforts across the federal states. As a result, the federal states have very differing and at times insufficient climate protection policies. Claimants ask the Constitutional Court to declare parts of the amended KSG unconstitutional and to order the federal legislature to re-regulate the reduction pathway in light of new scientific constraints, and to make provision for the distribution of the reduction burden across the federal states.

The plaintiff also argued that the defendant failed to provide prevention tools to avoid fires in the concession. The MoEF then explained forestry regulations in Indonesia obliging every license holder to provide fires control measures—in which the defendant considered violating its obligations. The MoEF claimed that fires inside the concession had caused significant environmental damages. These damages comprise of ecological damage, damage to biodiversity and carbon release, and economic losses due to land degradation. Accordingly, the MoEF sought compensation of IDR 115 billion and restoration costs amounting to IDR 250 billion. \r\n\r\nFor the carbon losses, the MoEF stated two type of climate damages caused by the defendant. Firstly, the fires inside the concession areas had released 13,500 tC into the atmosphere. The MoEF set that the carbon release cost is IDR 90,000 per ton which costs the defendant of IDR 1.2 billion. Secondly, the MoEF claimed that the fires had also reduced the ability to absorb CO2 of the peatland. A total of IDR 425.3 million was required to repair the losses. \r\n\r\nOn January 8, 2014, the district court granted half of the plaintiff’s claim against the defendant. Nonetheless, the district court decided that the defendants had violated the regulations and were liable for all environmental losses. On August 15, 2014, the Court of Appeal upheld the lower court decision. On August 28, 2015, the Supreme Court upheld the district court decision and refused a cassation from the defendant. On February 10, 2017, the defendant filed request for an extraordinary review (peninjauan kembali) and brought new evidence. The defendant argued that judges on lower court based their judgment with inadmissible evidence as regulated in Article 1866 of Indonesia Civil Code. On April 18, 2017, the Supreme Court once again rejected the request (peninjauan kembali) and upheld the lower court ruling.",

The MoEF argued that the defendant had intentionally burn the peatlands area to clear the land for timber planting purposes. Thus, the MoEF requested the court to declare that defendant liable for damages amounting to IDR 5.299 trillion and restoration costs for IDR 2.687 trillion. With damages and restoration cost amounting almost to IDR 8 trillion, this lawsuit is ranked among the highest damages in Indonesian forest fires litigation. In relation to climate damages, the MoEF argued that fires on the peatlands had caused in the release of 135,000 tC and 5,670 tCO2. The MoEF set the price for reduction and restoration of carbon on IDR 90,000. Hence, the total of restoration costs for the release of Carbon and Carbon Dioxide, respectively, were IDR 12.2 billion and IDR 4.3 billion. \r\n\r\nOn December 30, 2015, District Court of Palembang ruled in favor of the defendant and rejected all the plaintiff’s claim.

On May 3, 2016, the Court of Appeal overruled the district court decision on the grounds that the damages had occurred in the form of air pollution and damages on the peatlands. The court of appeal also awarded the plaintiff the restoration costs for climate damages in the full amount as requested.\r\n",

The plaintiff argued that the issuance of the permit was against the 2009 EPMA and Government Regulation No. 36 of 2010 on Nature Tourism Business in Wildlife Sanctuaries, National Parks, Grand Forest Parks and Nature Tourism Parks because it did not involve the community in the permit application process and had the potential to cause damage to the mangrove ecosystem.

      "summary": "This is a Public Civil Action filed by the Public Ministry of the State of São Paulo (MPSP) against the company KLM - Cia Real Ho Holanda de Aviação for alleged environmental damage resulting from commercial activities carried out by the defendant at São Paulo International Airport, in Cumbica, Garulhos, through the landing and take-off of their aircraft. \r\n\r\nThe company is required to remediate or provide compensation for environmental damage, especially with regard to the emission of Greenhouse Gases (GHG). The initial petition requests an obligation of forest restoration in an area in the same hydrographic basin in sufficient quantity to fully absorb the emissions of GHGs and other pollutants resulting from the activity. In response, the company alleged that the applicant filed 35 actions identical to the present one and that the São Paulo State Court of Justice (TJSP), by design, recognized the ineptitude of 26 of the initial petitions and expressed the merits of the action in only one of the cases, case 224.01.2010.082070-8, proposed against EMIRATES AIRLINES, having dismissed the remaining requests. \r\n\r\nThe company argued (i) its passive illegitimacy, given that it performs its activity in accordance with the determinations of the National Civil Aviation Agency (ANAC), and cannot be held responsible for complying with what is authorized and imposed by the Public Power; and (ii) legal impossibility of the request since there would be no illegal activity practiced by the Defendant. In the first instance, the Court understood that the Defendant had governmental authorization for the exercise of certain routes and the emissions resulting from the normal exercise of said activity would already be included in the scope of that authorization. On appeal before the TJSP (Appeal 0082072-08.2010.8.26.0224), the MPSP, on the merits, again requested the mitigation and repair of the environmental damage caused by the defendant. Subsequently, the National Civil Aviation Agency (ANAC) joined the action requesting the intervention as a third party and the remittance of the case to the federal court. \r\n\r\nA decision was handed down in the TJSP rejecting the preliminary presented by the MPSP and, in view of the ANAC's manifestation, it decided to refer the case to the Federal Regional Court of the 3rd Region (TRF-3). In this sense, it should be noted that the present action was initially filed in the State Court of São Paulo (TJSP), but was later referred to the Federal Court, due to the request for intervention by ANAC. The action was registered in the TRF-3 under the Civil Appeal number 0046991-68.2012.4.03.9999. Within the scope of the appeal, the TRF-3 decided to dismiss it, following the understanding of the court of origin, which understood that there was an environmental licensing process already carried out for Guarulhos Airport and authorization for the landing and take-off activity drawn up by ANAC . From this ruling, the MPSP filed a Special Appeal (REsp 1,856,031/SP) with the STJ, where there was a monocratic decision that followed the position of the court of origin in order to emphasize the specific regulation of the activity by ANAC and its efforts in terms of regarding the measurement and mitigation of emissions by the airline industry. It was understood that there would be no need to talk about an illicit act practiced by the business company (or even pollution), with the MPSP intending to impose an unforeseen regulation. After the decision, the REsp was written off to the court of origin. \r\n\r\nThe present case is one among other similar ones proposed by the MPSP against more than 30 airlines that operated at São Paulo International Airport. The Public Prosecutor of Sao Paulo brought a group of several cases seeking to compel airlines that make use of the region's international airport to offset their emissions. The court consolidated the cases against the various defendants: United Airlines, TAAG Linhas Aéreas de Angola, Delta Airlines, Cia. Mexicana, Emirates Airlines, Aerolineas Argentinas, and South African Airways. The means of offset requested was support for reforestation in the region. The court rejected the suits against several of the airlines on the grounds that it lacked jurisdiction over the claims.\r\n\r\nThe Superior Court of Justice (STJ) issued a decision upholding the ruling from the Federal Court of Appeals.

The defendants failed to consider the climate change goals that informed the adoption of the Environment Act when issuing the permit. There was a risk of irreparable damage as the defendants failed to demonstrate how the environmental impact assessment and the permit meet the requirements of the Act. Furthermore, the permit was granted for 50 years, 20 years more than the estimate life of a mine of 30 years. Noting the global impacts of greenhouse gas emissions, the judge noted that the parties did not provide any information on whether the environmental impact assessment factors levels of CO2 emissions and impacts on local and global environment and proposed measures to minimize such emissions. As part of an EIA analysis, the court noted that the assessment should include a question on \"What  climate  change  related  risks  have  been  identified  and  what adaption and mitigation programs if any have been built into the EIS and  the  deep sea tailings placement (DSTP)  and  how  will  that  be  monitored  and  reviewed  and enforced?\" The judge thus issued an order of stay of the two decisions pending a hearing and determination of the substantive review.

      "summary": "On March 17, 2021, the two UN Special Procedures on human rights and hazardous wastes, Mr. Orellana, and human rights and the environment, Mr. Boyd, issued communications to Bosnia Herzegovina (BiH) and China in relation to the approval for construction or extension of several coal-fired power plants in BiH by Chinese-State Owned Enterprises and with finance from the China Development Bank. \r\n\r\nCivil society complained that the plants lead to water and air pollution, and negative effects on climate change. Amongst other complaints, it was noted that whilst air pollution is already a significant concern in BiH, especially in areas where coal fired plants are operating, new units and plants are still being planned and constructed. This will “negatively affect the air quality and public health for decades,” through emissions of PM2.5, NO2 and SO2, over hundreds of kilometers. Some adverse health impacts associated with one of the power stations (Tuzla) include thousands of cases of (chronic) bronchitis and asthma in children and adults, and over 150 hospitalizations for respiratory issues and cardiac arrest. It was also noted that the coal-fired plants negatively affect neighboring countries; under the Espoo Convention on EIA in a Transboundary Context, transboundary air pollution requires an IEA and a notification of neighboring countries about potential transboundary pollution from coal power plants. \r\n\r\nAccording to the communication, the situation raises serious concerns about both BiH and China’s failure to meet “international human rights obligations for human and environmental rights.” This includes the human rights to a healthy environment, life, health, bodily integrity, safe drinking water and sanitation. Moreover, the construction and operation of the new coal fired power plants “exacerbate the already dangerous conditions of climate change by adding, and failing to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases.” Several procedural environmental human rights were affected too, due to alleged failures to provide adequate information, access to justice and effective remedies on negative health impacts resulting from the plant’s emissions.\r\n\r\nStates bear obligations under the international human rights law framework to protect against human rights abuse within their territories and/or jurisdiction, by third parties, including business enterprises. Meeting these obligations requires States to take appropriate steps to prevent, investigate, punish, and redress any abuse through effective policies, legislation, regulations, and adjudication, including in the sphere of environmental protection. The international legal instruments which form the basis for obligations are set out in an Annex, and include protection of aforementioned rights under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenants on Economic Social and Cultural Rights, and Civil and Political Rights, the Convention on Rights of the Child, the UNECE Aarhus Convention, the UN Framework Principles on Human Rights and Environment, and the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. The communication reiterates applicability of HRC General Comment No. 36 on the right to life with dignity to environmental degradation, pollution and climate change (paras. 26, 62) and the importance of protecting underlying environmental determinants of health under Article 14 ICESCR and 24 CRC, and related general comments.\r\n\r\nCommunications of the Special Procedures are not binding and cannot afford direct remedies, but the communication asked both BiH and China to, inter alia: (a) indicate measures to ensure how the plants comply with applicable national law, international environmental laws, and international human rights standards, including the right to information; (b) harmonize procedures for environmental permitting and regulation systems, including by conducting environmental human rights impact assessments based on comprehensive and consistent standards; (c) provide information and monitor negative health impacts of the plant; and (d) prevent negative human rights and environmental outcomes, e.g. by enforcing the polluter pays principle. It asked China to provide information on the impacts and damages of the pollution caused by Chinese-supported coal powered plants on global climate change, the environment and local communities; or to provide information on measures to ensure that projects under China’s Belt and Road Initiative contribute to the decarbonization of the host states of projects an do not compromise mitigation objectives of the Paris Agreement on climate change.   \r\nBiH did not respond to the communication. China replied on May 27, 2021, by stating that “allegations of human rights violations by the project in question are not based on fact; they are purely false accusations.” According to China, it actively assumes international responsibility for climate change, including to the Green Silk Road. It always requires enterprises to carry out foreign projects in compliance with the laws of countries or regions where they are located, and financial institutions abide by the concept of green credit. Specifically, the Tuzla plant is intended to replace outdated local units, and meet environmental requirements under EU carbon emissions standards, with positive benefits for the environment and ‘huge’ local social and economic benefit through development and reliable energy supply.",

      "summary": "On September 9, 2019, and on April 10, 2020, energy company Vattenfall attained permits to construct and use a new biomass facility at an existing energy generation facility in Diemen, currently encompassing two gas facilities and a residual warmth facility. Several non-governmental organisations, including Cooperatie Mobilisation for the Environment UA (MOB) and Natuurmonumenten, and local residents, objected the permit due to concerns for negative effects on nature and their (living) environments due to harmful emissions, particularly nitrogen oxide (NOx), fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and CO2. Applicants argued that CO2 was not accounted for at all, but that the burning of wood pellets in this new biomass facility would lead to more CO2 emissions per unit of generated energy than a coal-fired plant. This increases the atmospheric concentration of CO2, accelerating global warming. They also argued that this violates the Paris Agreement, EU law and the national Climate Law.\r\n\r\nOn June 7, 2021, the District Court of North Holland ruled that the arguments of applicants related to CO2 emissions are not relevant to the permit procedure, since no evidence was presented on the direct and specific effects of CO2 emissions or global warming on the municipality of Diemen and it inhabitants. The evidence mostly referred to worldwide effects of CO2 emissions on the climate, rather than specific effects of the operation of the new biomass facility on the (direct) environment of the facility. Moreover, the court stated that, as affirmed in the Urgenda-case, the Paris Agreement lacks direct effects in the Dutch legal order. Third parties cannot directly derive rights or legal obligations from it. Even so, it is up to the Dutch government to decide which measures it takes to meet its climate targets, and the government has motivated its decision to pursue biomass on the basis because it views this  fuel as necessary for the energy transition, and biomass is viewed as a CO2-neutral ‘renewable energy source’ under the Paris Agreement. The court explicitly states that the ‘political-governance’ choice to use biomass as a transitional fuel, and whether this is indeed a suitable fuel that would allow States to meet their climate targets is not an aspect that can be considered during a permit procedure, or assessed by a court in a related procedure. Since biomass is considered a CO2-neutral energy source under the Paris Agreement, the court decides not to consider the applicants’ arguments and calculations related to CO2 emissions, definitions of biomass under REDD I and REDD II, carbon debt, regeneration periods for wood stocks, and carbon capture and storage. The case was dismissed on all counts.",

In their claim, they demand the shutdown of two units of the thermoelectric power plant AES Gener Guacolda. The plaintiffs indicate that while Chile is a party to the Paris Agreement and has recently approved an agreement on the decarbonization of coal-fired power plants, it still decided - without justification - that the closure of Guacolda will only take place in 2040. \r\n\r\nThe plaintiffs claim that the decision violates their constitutional rights to life, to live in an environment free of pollution, and equality before the law. According to them, the power plant's emissions are affecting the health of residents and neighbors of Huasco. They request a plan from the government to mandate the shutdown of the two units of the thermoelectric power plant and a compensation plan for the harmful emissions.\r\n\r\nIn its response, the Government of Chile requested the dismissal of the complaint as it argued there was no breach of fundamental rights. The government explained that decarbonization is voluntary for both the executive branch and the private companies. They point out that the Ministry of Energy's Decree No. 50/2020, approving the decarbonization agreement, is an administrative act that is constantly updated. Further, the decision to close the power plant relies on a combination of factors.\r\n\r\nOn May 2, 2022, the Court of Appeals of Copiapo rejected the claim on procedural grounds. The Court found that the matter in question was beyond its competence, as it involved the exercise of powers belonging to the executive branch.

The company is increasingly present in Africa, and is the only oil operator present in the DRC. According to Friends of the Earth, Perenco has been implicated in numerous reports, investigations and interpellations by the Congolese Senate, local associations, and international NGOs for serious environmental and health violations.\r\n\r\nSherpa and Friends of the Earth France would like to take legal action to determine Perenco's responsibility for the reported pollution and environmental damage, and to obtain compensation, if necessary. Given the opacity of the operations and organization of the oil multinational, they have first initiated an action under article 145 of the Code of Civil Procedure to obtain more evidence of the link between Perenco France and the companies operating locally in the DRC. \r\n\r\nUnder article 145 of the Code of Civil Procedure, any interested party may ask the French judge for an investigative measure if there is a legitimate reason to preserve or establish, before any proceedings, evidence that could be relevant to the resolution of a dispute., provided that the action envisaged is not manifestly inadmissible or would be contrary to the law or doomed to failure.\r\n\r\nIn 2019, Sherpa and Friends of the Earth France requested authorization to access internal documents of the company Perenco, to determine its role in activities denounced as harmful to the environment in the DRC. The Tribunal de Grande Instance of Paris and then the Paris Court of Appeal denied their request on September 17, 2020. Therefore, they “appealed” to the Court of Cassation.\r\n\r\nThe multinational argued that the case was inadmissible and should be decided according to Congolese law (which would have prevented the associations from gaining access to the evidence requested). The associations argued the admissibility of the action should be decided according to French law, which explicitly allows for action for compensation for ecological damage. They argued that they had standing and that the case was admissible because (i) they are an environmental protection association established in France, (ii) requesting all measures to preserve evidence that could determine the outcome of a future lawsuit to engage the liability of a company whose registered office is located in France, for environmental infringements carried out abroad.\r\n\r\nOn March 9, 2022, the Court of Cassation dismissed the Court of Appeal’s ruling. The Court of Cassation held that an organization’s standing to act in defense of a collective interest to obtain a measure of inquiry based on article 145 of the Code of Civil Procedure is assessed, not concerning the foreign law applicable to the action on the merits (in this instance, the Congolese law), but rather in accordance with (i) the law of the forum (lex fori) to determine the conditions for initiating the action and (ii) the law governing the corporate group for the limits of the corporate object within which it is initiated.\r\n \r\nTherefore, the right to request any measures to preserve or establish evidence that could be relevant to the outcome of a case with a view to holding a company, whose registered office is located in France, liable for environmental damage observed abroad, is defined in the lex fori. The lex fori (or law of the forum) is an international law principle, which provides that the law of the jurisdiction or venue in which a legal action is brought applies. ",

      "type": "case",
      "count": 1,
      "summary": "In this case, the plaintiffs, Altius Royalty Corporation, Genesee Royalty Limited Partnership and Genesee Royalty GP Inc., alleged de facto expropriation of their royalty interest in coal from the Genesee Coal Mine caused by the defendant federal government’s regulations prohibiting coal-fired electricity generation by 2030 and the agreement between the owners of Genesee Power Plant and the government of Alberta, also a defendant, for the provision of transition payments to the owners of such plant in exchange for ceasing coal-fired emissions from the plant by December 31, 2030. \r\n\r\nThe case was first heard by a Master, who, among other things, granted the defendants’ motion for summary dismissal of the plaintiffs’ claim for de facto expropriation of its royalty interest (Altius Royalty Corporation v. Alberta, 2021 ABQB 3).\r\n\r\nThe plaintiffs have a royalty interest in coal produced from the Genesee Coal Mine in Alberta, which is dedicated to fueling the Genesee Power Plant. The plant generates coal-fired electricity for the City of Edmonton and elsewhere. The plaintiffs paid, collectively, $460 million for the royalty interest in the coal at the mine.    \r\n\r\nIn 2012, the federal government adopted the Reduction of Carbon Dioxide Emissions from Coal-Fired Generation of Electricity Regulations (“2012 Regulations”) aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions from coal-fired electricity plants, which did not directly bind the Genesee Power Plant at the time. The 2012 Regulations permitted the plant to operate as it was from an emissions perspective until its power plant units would be deemed to end their useful life (estimated to be in 2039, 2044 and 2055) under the 2012 Regulations. The plaintiffs claimed that because the 2012 Regulations permitted the units to operate as they were from an emissions perspective for 50 years from their commissioning dates, a reduction in that ability entitled the plaintiffs to compensation. \r\n\r\nIn 2015, the government of Alberta introduced its “Climate Leadership Plan” which aimed to phase out emissions from coal-fired electricity generation by 2030. The government of Alberta entered into an off-coal agreement with the owners of the Genesee Power Plant, where the owners agreed to end emissions from coal-fired electricity generation by 2030 and, in return, the government of Alberta agreed to pay certain transition payments. The plaintiffs alleged that by entering into the agreement with the Genesee Power Plant owners, the government of Alberta engaged in conduct that compensated the plant owners but excluded the plaintiffs. \r\n\r\nIn 2018, new federal regulations came into force amending the 2012 Regulations (the “2018 Regulations”). The 2018 Regulations affected existing plants, including the Genesee Power Plant, and required that they meet the new emissions standards set out in the regulation by December 31, 2029. The plaintiffs alleged that, based on the 2012 Regulations, the plaintiffs had counted upon the royalty stream being available to 2039, 2044 and 2055. The plaintiffs alleged that the 2018 Regulations amounted to a constructive expropriation or “taking” by the federal government of its royalty interest in the coal after 2030. \r\n\r\nThe Master found that the 2012 Regulations, as amended by the 2018 Regulations, was not a “taking” by the federal government and that the actions of the government of Alberta to enter into an off-coal agreement (and other actions) compensating the Genesee Power Plant owners did not amount to takings or actionable wrongs. These actions therefore did not create a cause of action in favour of the plaintiffs. For those reasons, the Master dismissed the plaintiffs’ actions. \r\n\r\nIn reviewing the Master’s decision to grant summary dismissal of the plaintiffs’ claim for de facto expropriation, the Court determined whether the defendants had met the requirements for a finding of a de facto taking requiring compensation at common law: (i) an acquisition of a beneficial interest in the property or flowing from it and (ii) removal of all reasonable uses of the property. The Court found that the requirements had not been met, as there was no evidence that the defendants would, in some way, recover a freehold interest in the coal and that the defendants have an interest in keeping the coal in the ground (in its natural state). The Court found that the defendants’ interest was reducing Canada’s production of greenhouse gas emissions, as manifested in the Paris Agreement and the 2012 Regulations, as amended by the 2018 Regulations. The Court agreed with the Master’s finding that the defendants had proven on a balance of probabilities that there was no merit to the plaintiffs’ claim. \r\n",

To supply water to the city of Izmir, the government designated the water resources to the Gördes Dam, which resulted as a loss of resource for Marmara Lake and to it drying up within the last ten years, loosing almost ninety-eight percent of its surface area. Although the lake is almost dried up, the Manisa Directorate of Provincial Agriculture and Forestry has requested rent from the Claimant, a cooperative union of fishermen active in the Marmara Lake, for the fishery license and issued an order of payment. The Claimant, alleging that the reason for the drought is the wrong policies and inaction of the administration and stating that their income has decreased, and some members even left the fishery, requested the annulment of the order of payment. After the drought, many families that fished had to migrate. The Claimant asserts that the administration failed its duty to protect the Marmara Lake and other wetlands as carbon sinks with inadequate policies and insufficient environmental impact assessments for projects, which resulted in it drying up. Considering the obligation to mitigate climate change under the UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement, which are immediately enforceable under the Turkish Constitution, the government has failed to fulfill its international obligations. As a result, annulment of the payment order issued by the administration is requested. ",

      "type": "case",
      "count": 1,
      "summary": "This is a State Direct Action of Unconstitutionality, with a request for a precautionary measure, filed by the Public Prosecutor's Office of the State of Rondônia (MPRO) due to the publication of state Complementary Law (LC) 1.089/2021, initiated by the State Governor, questioning in particular: (i) art. 1º, caput, and its paragraphs 1º and 2º; (ii) art. 2º, caput and paragraphs 1º and 2º; (iii) art. 15, caput and sole paragraph; (iv) art. 17, caput and its items; and (v) Annexes I, II, V, VI, VII and VIII. The author points out that the LC reduces the area of the Jaci-Paraná Extractive Reserve and the Guajará-Mirim State Park and, as compensation, creates the Ilha das Flores and Abaitará State Parks, the Bom Jardim and Limoeiro Sustainable Development Reserves and the Pau D'Óleo Fauna Reserve. In addition, the LC allows the environmental regularization of the property or possession of the owners or possessors in the disused areas of the Extractive Reserve and the State Park. It states that these Conservation Units (UCs) are illegally occupied and deforestation occurs to the detriment of the rights of traditional populations (extractivists and others), being used mainly for livestock farming. The removal of these areas directly impacts the Uru-eu-wau-wau, Karipuna, Igarapé Lage, Igarapé Ribeirão, Karitina Indigenous Lands and the peoples in voluntary isolation in the surrounding region. \r\n\r\nIt argues that the reduction in Conservation Units, by harming environmental protection and contradicting the purpose for which the UCs were created, violates the right to an ecologically balanced environment and the duty of the public authorities and the community to defend and preserve it for present and future generations. It points out that the creation of new protected areas by the LC is insufficient and is an environmental step backwards. In addition, it argues that no hearings were held with the communities affected during the project that resulted in the LC and that no technical studies were carried out to remove the areas, which violates the principles of prevention and precaution. It argues that the precautionary measure should be granted because there is a risk of irreversible environmental damage and an imminent risk to the lives of indigenous peoples and traditional populations. It emphasizes that the Jaci-Paraná Extractive Reserve is already the 2nd most deforested in the Legal Amazon, while the Guajará-Mirim State Park is the 9th most deforested. Finally, it requests, among other things: (i) an injunction suspending the effectiveness of the provisions in question; and (ii) on the merits, a declaration that the provisions are unconstitutional, with the decision to be communicated to the Legislative Assembly to suspend their implementation.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a monocratic decision, the Reporting Judge, José Jorge Ribeiro da Luz, decided that the Court should rule only the merits of the action, because, since the precautionary measure in the ADI must be granted by an absolute majority of the members of the Court, the time for both would end up being the same. In the same decision, he granted the request for admission as amicus curiae of the Minas Novas Rural Producers Association (ASPRUMIN).\r\n\r\n\r\nSubsequently, the request for admission as amicus curiae of the Association for Ethno-Environmental Defense (KANINDÉ), the Organization of Indigenous Peoples of the Guarajá-Mirim Region (Oro Wari), Ecoporé Ecological Action (ECOPORÉ), the SOS Amazon Association (SOS Amazônia) and the World Wildlife Fund (WWF-Brazil) was granted. It is noteworthy that, in their amicus curiae briefs, the organizations, in defending the unconstitutionality of LC 1.089/21, pointed out that the rule represents damage to biodiversity, to local traditional and indigenous populations and to climate stability by summarily acquitting environmental offenders who have occupied and degraded protected areas, receiving the seal of approval from the Government. They highlighted the violation of the principles of prevention and precaution, set out in the National Environmental Policy - PNMA (Federal Law 6.938/1981) and the National Policy on Climate Change - PNMC (Federal Law 12.187/2009), as well as the violation of the right to prior, free and informed consultation of affected indigenous and traditional peoples, in accordance with Convention 169 of the International Labor Organization (ILO). They argued that the reduction of UCs results in climate damage, violating the right to climate stability provided for in art. 225 of the Federal Constitution and also argued that there is a failure by the Government to implement the PNMC and the State Policy on Climate Governance and Environmental Services - PGSA (State Law 4.437/2018).\r\n\r\nA ruling was rendered, in line with the vote of the Reporting Judge, who, by a majority, declared the unconstitutionality of the contested provisions, as well as recognizing the unconstitutionality of LC 1.096/2021, which amends the wording of §1 of art. 2 of LC 1.089/2021. It concluded that there were no prior studies for the disqualification of the Units of Conservation, in violation of the precautionary principle, the principle of prevention and the prohibition of environmental retrogression. He stressed that it is the duty of the Government to protect the environment, and that the justification for anthropization and degradation in the areas is flawed. It also considered that the principles of ubiquity and intergenerational solidarity had been violated. It is worth highlighting the vote of Judge Miguel Monico Neto, who, although also recognizing the unconstitutionality of the rules, was defeated in the part where he stressed the need for a structuring measure due to the abuse of the legislative institutional function of the State Governor and the Legislative Assembly. The judge emphasized the importance of the UCs for protection against the climate emergency and argued that the environmental impacts resulting from new agricultural projects in the area, if the reduction in protected areas were to be implemented, would represent a threat to the environment, water security, the safety of the climate system, soil fertility, atmospheric air, fauna and flora, the health and lives of present and future generations, as well as the sustainability of agriculture and livestock and the export of state and Brazilian products.\r\n\r\nAn interlocutory appeal (ARE 1417998) was filed against the decision to reject the extraordinary appeal, which was denied admissibility due to the lack of pre questioning and the need to discuss factual matters. The Minas Novas Rural Producers' Association (Asprumin) was admitted as amicus curiae in the ARE. Subsequently, an interlocutory appeal was filed in the ARE, which was not upheld on the same grounds as the contested decision.\r\n\r\nThe appeals were unsuccessful and, as a result, the lawsuit was dismissed.",

      "summary": "On May 6, 2020, the Federal Public Prosecutor's Office (MPF) and two NGOs, SOS Mata Atlântica and ABRAMPA, filed a public civil action (environmental class-action) against the Federal Government, seeking a declaration of nullity of Order 4.410/2020 issued by the Ministry of the Environment (MMA). The plaintiffs claim that the contested Order changed the understanding consolidated in the previous MMA Order 64.773/2017 on the specialty and prevalence of the Atlantic Forest Law (Federal Law 11.428/2006) over the Forest Code (Federal Law 12.651/2012) concerning the protection of the Atlantic Forest biome. It so happens that Order 4.410/2020 imposed guidance on federal public entities to apply the Forest Code, which is a less protective general rule, allowing the consolidation of occupation of protected areas (APP) illegally deforested (until July 22, 2008). The plaintiffs aim, among other things, to prevent the cancellation of several environmental infraction notices for deforestation and fires as a result of the possible consolidation of occupation of APP. They point out that the largest source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the country is deforestation and changes in land use, and that special legislation, such as the National Policy on Climate Change (PNMC – Federal Law 12.187/2009), establishes the duty to preserve, conserve and restore Brazil’s natural biomes such as the Atlantic Forest. Finally, they request, as an injunction, (i) the suspension of the effects of the contested Order 4.410/2021 and (ii) the reinstatement of the effects of MMA Order 64.773/2017. On the merits, they request the confirmation of the injunction with (i) a declaration that the Order 4.410/2021 is null and void and (ii) an order that the Federal Government refrain from issuing another normative act denying the prevalence of the special legislation of the Atlantic Forest over the Forest Code.\r\nIn its defense, the Federal Government argued that the action had lost its object, due to the spontaneous revocation of Order 4.410/2020, and pointed out that the matter had been brought before the Federal Supreme Court (STF), and that it was up to that Court to determine the best interpretation of the issue. Accordingly, it requested that the case be dismissed.\r\nIn a judgment based on procedural grounds, the court ruled that the plaintiffs had no interest in acting and dismissed the case, without resolving the merits.

The case relates to large scale and uncontrolled forest fires ravaging the States of Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh thereby undermining the ecological sustainability of an already endangered biological zone. Emissions released by forest fires include carbon dioxide CO2, carbon monoxide (CO), and methane (CH4), organic aerosols and black carbon, non-methane organic compounds, nitrogen oxides (NOx), and Sulphur dioxide (SO2). These emissions affect the efficiency of both atmospheric and surface absorption of solar energy, with resultant cooling and or warming effects. Forest fires have a devastating effect on the glaciers of Uttarakhand, which are the life line of major north Indian rivers, have been covered by ‘black carbon’ causing them to melt faster. The respondents, States of Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh, contended that the year 2016 saw extremely low rainfall thereby causing a serious moisture deficit in the soil and in the forest areas, thereby making conditions conducive to the occurrence and spread of forest fires. \r\n\r\nThe NGT saw merit in the respondents’ argument but required a better advance planning and implementation of the Fire Management Plan and Crisis Management plan for forest fires. Accordingly, the NGT directed the central and respective state governments to formulate national policy and guidelines for forest fire prevention and control. The respective States must prepare and implement forest fire management plan for effective prevention and control of forest fire. \r\n\r\nThe tribunal specifically asked the Chief secretaries of both the states to ensure that adequate resources and manpower are “placed at the disposal of the forest department both at the state and district/division level, at the beginning of each financial year.” Consequently, both the States developed their respective plans but the implementation was partial being limited by staff and financial constraints. In 2019, the NGT issued interim orders directing robust institutional mechanism for an effective implementation of the action plans for controlling forest fires.",

      "summary": "In 2016, the applicant, an environmental society, filed a case before the NGT raising objections to the 2016 draft notification that exempts building and construction projects from the environmental clearance requirement. According to the applicant, the unregulated building and construction activities would cause irreversible damage to the environment, thereby having serious repercussions on climate change. This exemption is also in derogation of India’s international commitments to the Rio Declaration 1992 and Paris Agreement 2015, especially when read in the light of the precautionary principle. The respondent, Ministry of Environment and Forests, contended that the draft notification is a policy decision taken by the Government of India to provide affordable housing to the weaker section of the society under the ‘Housing for All by 2022’ scheme. The NGT, exercising its jurisdiction, upheld the applicant’s contention. The 2016 draft notification considerably dilutes the regime of environmental clearance in building and construction activities, thereby, leading to severe environmental impacts. The principle of non-regression, an accepted norm in international environmental law, mandates that environmental law should not be modified to the detriment of environmental protection.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the NGT declared illegal those parts of a government draft notification that exempted specific building and construction projects from the environmental clearance requirement. Domestically, the construction sector emits 22% of India’s total annual carbon-dioxide emission and has a significant energy footprint. In the name of ‘ease of doing responsible business’, the government ignored environmental impacts that have a direct bearing on environmental protection, climate change and sustainable development. Environmental clearances, as a part of the precautionary approach, require the drafting of an EIA report.\r\n\r\nThe EIA report evaluates carbon emissions associated with the construction project, its adverse impact on the environment, and best practice strategies to reduce these emissions. This helps in achieving the ambitious targets and is directly linked to the climate change and SDGs.",

      "summary": "In 2013, the applicants, a welfare residents association, challenged the construction and operation of the waste-to-energy plant by the Municipal Corporation of Delhi (MCD). The plant to be established in a densely populated residential area would be dangerous to the lives of the residents. The incineration of unsegregated municipal solid waste emits large quantities of GHG, including carbon dioxide and nitrogen oxides thereby contributing to global climate change. They are also a large source of indirect GHG, including carbon monoxide, non-methane volatile organic compounds and sulphur dioxide. The incinerator also emits more CO2 per MW/hour than any fossil fuel- based power source including coal/fuel power plants. The respondents, MCD, argued that the plant is a state- of-the-art facility and offers a clean, efficient and effective alternative to dumping of municipal solid waste in landfill sites. It is in the public interest that the plant operate.\r\n\r\nOn February 2, 2017, the NGT, however, allowed the operation of the plant. The need of the hour is to ensure processing of the municipal waste with least residue by recourse to developed and tested technologies. Examining public health and interest in conjunction with environmental protection, the balance tilts in favor of permitting the plant to continue its operation of processing the municipal solid waste from waste to energy. The applicability of precautionary principle through monitoring and adherence to stringent standards would ensure that there are no adverse impacts on public health and environment.\r\n\r\nImportantly, the NGT observed that the plant in question has been developed as a Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) project. CDM projects, as registered with UNFCCC, are projects that adopt precision in technology that take care of environmental issues as per the international standards including stoppage of generation of GHG emissions. They are considered to be environment friendly, and are thus eligible for carbon credit.\r\n\r\nAccording to the tribunal, the project proponent adopted anti-pollution measures, improved technology, introduced new mechanism for segregation and brought emissions not only within the prescribed limits but even to the more stringent standards imposed by the regulatory authorities.

Individuals and companies can purchase these assets' carbon credits on the voluntary market to offset GHG emissions. Carbonext acquires carbon credits from projects it manages or from assets purchased from other companies and resells them to finance environmental preservation and the development of local communities in the Amazon. The amounts obtained through the purchase and sale of carbon credits fund the environmental preservation and development of local communities in the Amazon Forest. Amazon Imóveis owns 3% of the carbon credits generated by the REDD+ project called “The Envira Amazonia Project – A Tropical Forest Conservation Project in Acre, Brazil.” \r\n\r\nCarbonext and Amazon Imóveis made a contract for the purchase of carbon credits. Amazon Imóveis promised to sell and transfer 331,080 carbon credits. Carbonext paid the price by December 31, 2021. The debtor had to transfer the assets within up to five business days, counted from the signing of the contract on February 26, 2021. In line with market practice, Carbonext requested the transfer of carbon credits as it sold to companies interested in neutralizing GHG emissions. Initially, Amazon Imóveis transferred 5,000 credits to the claimant, referring to the 2017 harvest. In April 2017,  Carbonext asked Amazon Imóveis to transfer 16,990 units of carbon credits, which they denied. Carbonext sent a pre-judicial letter requesting the transfer of credits, which was not complied with.\r\n\r\nOn July 12, 2021, Carbonext filed a lawsuit to execute the contractual obligation under the Civil Procedure Code (Federal Law 13,105/2015). The plaintiff requires the (i) transfer of 326,080 carbon credits by Amazon Imóveis to Carbonext within five business days and (ii) for the court to set up a daily fine if the transfer of credits is not done.  \r\n\r\nOn July 13, 2021, the court of first instance issued an official decision to warn the debtor to satisfy the obligation within fifteen days, under penalty of a daily fine. However, Amazon Imóveis did not fulfill the court order as it started judicial proceedings questioning the debt (motion to stay in execution, autonomous action no. 1088560-57.2021.8.26.0100 and interlocutory appeal with a request for preliminary injunction no. 2180421-19.2021.8.26.0000. The plaintiff requested the carbon credits' custodian, Carbonfund.org Foundation, to transfer the credits from Amazon Imóveis to the creditor, which was accepted by the court and complied with by Carbonfound. However, given non-compliance with the decision, Carbonext requested the payment of the amount related to the daily fine. Amazon Imóveis later informed the court that it had fully complied with the contractual obligations.

It seeks to prevent the implementation of the Carbon Chemical Complex in the State as well as the State Policy on Mineral Coal. The MPRS questions the lack of popular participation, especially through public hearings, in the legislative process of State Law 15.047/2017, which authorized the construction of the Carbon Chemical Pole and created the State Policy for Mineral Coal. In addition, it argues that there should be a prior Environmental Impact Assessment (EIS) for the implementation of the Pole, considering the climate impacts of the activities on the site, which will be placed in the complexes of Baixo Jacuí and Campanha, and a Strategic Environmental Assessment before its institution, which must consider the synergistic and global effects of all the activities. The author adds that the policy encourages the use of a highly impactful energy matrix regarding the emission of greenhouse gases (GHG). The MPRS emphasizes the proximity of the carbon-chemical complexes to protected areas and cities. The author alleges that the implementation of the Pole considers only the EIS specific to the Guaíba Mine, not taking into account the entire complex. It argues that the State Law does not consider, among other issues, environmental protection, at odds with the federal and state legislation on climate change. The granting of an injunction is required to prevent, among other measures, (i) the implementation of the State Policy on Mineral Coal and the establishment of the Pole and (ii) the issuance of an environmental license for an enterprise inserted in complexes, up to the realization of public hearings and the development of an EIS and a Strategic Environmental Assessment, prior to the implementation of the Carbon Chemical Pole and the State Policy on Mineral.

      "count": 1,
      "summary": "On August 12, 2013, ABRAGET filed a claim with a request for an injunction against the State of Rio de Janeiro. The plaintiff challenges State Decree 41,318/2008, which establishes the Energy Compensation Mechanism (ECM) as part of the Greenhouse Gas Emission Abatement Plan, in order to combat global warming and strengthen the energy supply in the State. \r\n\r\nThe decree imposes conditions for obtaining environmental permitting aimed specifically at companies in the energy sector based on fossil fuels, at the state level. The plaintiff states that the planned changes would demand high financial costs, excessively burdening the associated plants. It alleges a breach of the federal government's competence to legislate on electric energy. It further argues that the decree is unconstitutional due to a lack of a previous law to be regulated. It also adds a request for suspension of the effectiveness of the decree. This is based on the National Policy on Climate Change - PNMC (Federal Law 12.187/2009), which, as argued by the plaintiffs, supervened the decree, emphasizing that the national law does not establish any compensation for the energy sector. It clarifies that Brazil has internalized the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change - UNFCCC (enacted by Decree 2652/1998), but has made a reservation regarding Annex I, so that it is outside the goals of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. ABRAGET argues that the mitigation commitment provided for in the PNMC is voluntary, and not linked to the environmental permitting process. It requests (i) the granting of anticipation of the effects to suspend the effects of the decree and (i) at the end, the judicial determination for the State of Rio de Janeiro to refrain from enforcing Decree 41.318/2008. \r\n\r\nIn response, the defendant State pointed out on November 29, 2013 that the energy compensation mechanism was edited to mitigate and compensate for the scientifically unequivocal adverse environmental effects of energy production. It emphasized the common competence of the federative entities for the adoption of environmental protective measures, and that the member state observed the precautionary principle. The state argued that as thermoelectric plants are more polluting, the discrimination adopted by the State is in accordance with the reality of the facts, and the measure is proportional. The state argued that the decree was not incompatible with the PNMC. Finally, among other issues, it defended the legality and constitutionality of the decree and requested the dismissal of the plaintiff's request. \r\n\r\nOn March 6, 2015, the trial court dismissed the plaintiff's request, emphasizing that the judiciary, when carrying out control of public policies, must honor the purposes of the state, given that the decree contributes to the intergenerational maintenance of a healthy environment. The plaintiff appealed reaffirming the points of the initial petition and requested the annulment of the decision. On February 7, 2017, the appellate court considered the evidence of decree's unconstitutionality to be strong, raising an incident of unconstitutionality to be resolved before the Court's Special Body. \r\n\r\nOn September 12, 2017, within the scope of the claim of unconstitutionality, the Court's Special Body decided for the validity of the decree, emphasizing, among other issues, that it is an activity inherent to the environmental administrative function with a view to materializing protective measures for the environment. After the decision, the plaintiff stated that the discussion on the application of the decree to ABRAGET's associates remained. A decision was handed down stating that the appellant's claim - to determine the non-application of Decree 41.318/08 to its associates - is generic, not being possible to fulfill the request. In addition, the court stated that any assessment of the improper application of conditions to the contracts in force should be carried out in a separate action. Therefore, the author's appeal was dismissed. \r\n\r\nSubsequently, ABRAGET filed an Extraordinary Appeal, which was held inadmissible. The plaintiff filed an appeal to the Federal Supreme Court (STF). On August 7, 2018, within the scope of the Extraordinary Appeal (ARE 1.317.221/RJ), the Justice, in a monocratic decision, held that the Court has consolidated jurisprudence on the concurrent competence between the federated entities to legislate on environmental protection. Since it would be necessary to go through the factual-evidence review and the interpretation of local legislation to verify that the decree refers to environmental protection standards, and not electricity, it could not hear the case. \r\n\r\nThe plaintiffs further filed an Interlocutory Appeal, which was denied by the 2nd Panel of the Court.

Furthermore, the decree can cause irreversible environmental damage to the Amazon biome and the ecosystem services produced by the forest, which implies potential national and global impacts, especially regarding the service of climate regulation and rain distribution. The plaintiff argues that the decree can make it difficult to demonstrate compliance with the goals of the Paris Agreement. \r\n\r\nThe investigations that gave rise to the lawsuit were carried out in a civil inquiry that aimed to determine the legality of the release of sugarcane plantations in the Amazon, in the face of possible environmental damage resulting from the activity and the failure to adopt mitigating measures. The investigation arose out of a complaint by a researcher, based on scientific studies published in the journal Science, which demonstrated the economic and environmental consequences of allowing sugarcane cultivation in the Amazon and Pantanal biomes. The plaintiff request a granting a preliminary injunction for (i) the court to suspend the effects of Decree 10,084/2019, resuming the previous one, and (ii) that the Union refrain from issuing a new decree on this matter until it demonstrates, through technical and scientific studies, the plausibility of the measure in comparison with the duty to protect the environment. The plaintiff also requires, in a final request, to condemn the Union for material and collective moral damages. \r\n\r\nOn February 29, 2020, the Federal Government replied and (i) defended the legality and constitutionality of Decree 10,084/2019, claiming that the new decree is in accordance with the provisions of the RenovaBio program and with new production techniques, and Brazil must double production and use of ethanol as automotive fuel to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement, (ii) that the practice disciplined by the new decree must observe the environmental legal framework, especially environmental licensing, and (iii) the absence of objective responsibility of the State in reason due to lack of proof of damage. \r\n\r\nOn April 20, 20202, the court granted precautionary measures - later partially suspended by Interlocutory Appeal 1012253-37.2020.4.01.0000. The court immediately suspended the effects of Decree 10.084/2019, until the Union proved, within 180 days from the technical studies, the scientific and non-impacting feasibility that motivated the new legislation and the revocation of the previous one for the involved biomes. The appeal refers to the determination of communication by environmental licensing agencies, federal, state and municipal, of the Legal Amazon for the authorization/licensing of sugarcane planting activities in the region to be prohibited. \r\n\r\nA judgment in the first instance has not yet been handed down.",

      "summary": "On October 2, 20202, the political party Rede Sustentabilidade filed a constitutional claim (Allegation of Noncompliance with a Fundamental Precept (ADPF)) questioning CONAMA Resolution 500/2020, which revoked CONAMA Resolutions 284/2001, 302/2002 and 303/2002. The revoked resolutions regulated the permitting of irrigation activities and the definitions of permanent preservation areas (APPs) - a protected area within private properties - in artificial reservoirs, mangroves and sandbanks. Furthermore, it questions the new CONAMA Resolution 499/2020, which changed the permitting of waste processing activities in rotary kilns, revoking the CONAMA Resolution 264/1999. The plaintiff argues that (i) the burning of pesticides, (ii) the APPs and (iii) the modification of the form of environmental permitting for irrigation and burning of toxic waste are against environmental protection efforts. \r\n\r\nThe plaintiff claims that there is a violation of the fundamental right to an ecologically balanced environment, in view of the setback in norms that controlled activities with potential environmental degradation or potential increase in the waste of natural resources. No regulation aiming at the same ends of environmental protection was presented to replace the revoked norms, evidencing the socio-environmental setback with consequences that the authors claim will be felt by current and future generations regarding the water, climate and pollution agendas in a systemic way. When questioning the repeal of Resolution 303/2002, which deals with the protection of mangroves and sandbanks on the Brazilian coast as APPs, The plaintiff highlights its consequences for climate change. It argues that the restinga and mangrove areas contribute to carbon sequestration, being important for mitigating climate change, and helping reduce the vulnerability of the coastal zone, which are the areas most affected by these changes, demonstrating its importance for adaptation. The plaintiff emphasizes that the legal protection of these areas is necessary to enable, among other benefits, the achievement of the goals of the Paris Agreement. In addition, it reinforces the importance of CONAMA Resolution 303/2002 due to the special protection granted to the Atlantic Forest, especially with regard to restingas. Finally, in the discussions regarding CONAMA Resolution 499/2020, the GHG emissions that occur in the waste burning process are also mentioned. \r\n\r\nThe plaintiff request, as precautionary measures, the suspension of the effects of CONAMA Resolution 500/2020, with the return of validity of Resolutions 284/2001, 302/2002 and 303/2002; and the suspension of the new CONAMA Resolution 499/2020 on licensing the activity of co-processing waste in rotary kilns for the production of clinker, which revokes and replaces Resolution 264/1999. Definitively, the plaintiff request a declaration of the unconstitutionality of the Resolutions. \r\n\r\nJustice Rosa Weber determined the joint processing of this ADPF with ADPFs 747 and 748, due to the similarity of objects. On November 11, 2020, a monocratic decision, later confirmed by the Plenary of the Federal Supreme Court, partially granted the preliminary requests to suspend the effects of CONAMA Resolution 500/2020, with the immediate restoration of the validity and effectiveness of the CONAMA Resolutions 284/2001, 302/2002 and 303/2002. However, the request to suspend the effectiveness of CONAMA Resolution 499/2020 was rejected. \r\n\r\nA final decision confirmed the preliminary judgment and declared CONAMA Resolution 500/2020 unconstitutional, determining the immediate restoration of the validity and effectiveness of CONAMA Resolutions 284/2001, 302/2002 and 303/2002, dealing with licensing of irrigation activity and on parameters, definitions and limits of APPs, as it was understood that the mere revocation of rules necessary to comply with environmental legislation, without replacing or updating them, compromises compliance with the Constitution, current legislation and international commitments. The judgment of the preliminary decision regarding CONAMA Resolution 499/2020, on the licensing of waste co-processing activity in rotary clinker kilns, was also confirmed, rejecting the request as to its unconstitutionality based on the understanding that the new normative parameters established would be compatible with the constitutional text.

The project is the largest open pit coal mine in Brazil, with a high potential for water pollution. The plaintiff points out flaws in the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) of the project, neglecting to comply with important permitting phases, such as holding public hearings in affected communities. The plaintiff claims that the project poses a risk of pollution, especially to the Jacuí River, which contributes with 86.3% of the average flow of Lake Guaíba, which is responsible for supplying drinking water to several municipalities. It highlights the need to analyze the extent of possible environmental damage resulting from the undertaking and the synergies with other infrastructures designed for the region. It also argues that the Guaíba Mine Project will impact the balance of water resources, which is inextricably linked to climate change, and thus mobilizes the National Policy on Climate Change – PNMC (Federal Law 12,187/2009). Therefore, actions such as pollution of springs, diversion of water courses, lowering of water tables, drainage of aquifers, among other harmful measures related to the Project, are directly or indirectly related to climate change. It is required, among other points, (i) as a preliminary injunction, the suspension of the permitting process for the Guaíba Mina Project until the judgment on the merits, so that the installation of the mine is prohibited and (ii), on the merits, the prohibition of the installation of the project in the originally planned location, in view of the irreversible environmental damages that it will cause to the region, in addition to the declaration of nullity of the environmental licensing procedure with the initiation of a new procedure that contemplates all the risks and the elaboration of an action plan for emergency, with a view to mitigating the consequences of possible environmental damage. \r\n\r\nAfter the defendants' preliminary statements, a decision was rendered recognizing the passive illegitimacy of ANA and, consequently, the incompetence of the Federal Court to judge the action. Thus, the action was redistributed in the Court of Justice of the State of Rio Grande do Sul (TJRS). \r\n\r\nSubsequently, there was a decision determining the suspension of this process for six months, considering that the permitting procedure for the Guaíba Mine project was declared null and void in the scope of the case “Arayara Association of Education and Culture and others v. FUNAI, Copelmi Mineração Ltda. and FEPAM (Mina Guaíba Project and affected indigenous communities).\" The suspension was determined in order to await the exhaustion of the appeal phase and the confirmation or not of the decision of that lawsuit.\r\n\r\nIn April 2025, a judgment was handed down that dismissed the case without resolving the merits, due to the supervening loss of the object, given COPELMI's withdrawal from the Minas Guaíba Project and the consequent archiving of the environmental licensing process.",

The letter states that KLM will be sued in violation of European consumer law if it does not cease misleading advertisement claims under its ‘Fly Responsibly’ campaign to the effect that CO2 compensation measures and alternative fuels can make flying sustainable. The Fly Responsibly ads present the airline as “creating a more sustainable future” and on track to reduce its emissions to net zero by 2050.\r\n\r\nEnvironmental organisations FossielVrij NL, Reclame Fossielvrij en ClientEarth claim that there is no such thing as ‘flying responsibly’ at present, and that KLM seeks company growth and increased flight sales, whilst it should be reducing emissions by reducing the number of flights ‘to keep a just, liveable world within reach’. Specifically, the organizations claim that customers are offered to buy carbon offset – labelled ‘CO2ZERO’ – by funding reforestation projects or KLM’s purchase of biofuels, but that such labels are misleading and that such products do not make a meaningful contribution to reducing KLMs footprint. Moreover, KLM’s marketing undermines the urgent action needed to minimise climate catastrophe.\r\n\r\nThe case builds on a national decision of the national Advertisement Code Commission on 8 April 2022, the Dutch media watchdog dealing with complaints about misleading advertisement under the Advertisement Code. The commission ruled that elements of the ‘Fly Responsibly’ campaign violated the codes provisions on misleading advertising, especially those elements referring to ‘climate neutrality’ or ‘CO2ZERO’. This includes slogans like ““Be a hero, fly CO2ZERO” or “CO2 neutral: KLM compensates for the CO2 emissions of your KLM Holidays flight.” The Commission noted, inter alia, that whilst the reforestation program in which KLM invests meets certain recognized theoretical standards (e.g. Gold Standard certification), there exist doubts in practice and amongst experts that emission reduction certificates purchased by KLM, result in the full and permanent compensation 'down to zero' of personal flight footprints in practice, as suggested by the campaign. The absolute environmental claims of “CO2-neutrality” and “CO2ZERO” must be accompanied by sound, independent, verifiable and generally recognized evidence that in practice there is also guaranteed full compensation.\r\n\r\nOn July 6, 2022, FossielVrij NL v.

They note that mining and combustion of thermal coal make an outsized contribution to the aggravation and causation of the global climate crisis, with devasting effects on the ‘effective enjoyment of rights to life, health, and a healthy environment’. \r\n\r\nThe communication notes that according to recent reports from the IPCC, UNEP, IEA, and UNICEF, the negative effects of coal mining and combustion, including on children’s rights, are overwhelmingly clear and worrying. To achieve net zero emissions by 2050, ‘all countries need to immediately stop construction of new coal power plants, phase them out completely by 2030 in advanced communities and close all of them by 2040 globally’ to meet the Paris temperature targets. Amongst the concerns cited are that coal-fired electricity causes about 35% of total methane emissions from all fossil fuel related sources, an extremely potent greenhouse gas (GHG). \r\n\r\nIn follow up to G7 and other commitments, the Special procedures recommend that the Participants to the OECD Coal-Fired Electricity Generation Sector Understanding expand their commitment by agreeing to immediately (a) stop building new coal-fired power plants, (b) immediately terminate subsidies and export financing and guarantees for any and all actions related to coal-fired plants and exploration, extraction and production of thermal coal and associated infrastructure, without exceptions or exemptions;  (c) require existing coal-fired plants to be closed by 2030 in high-income nations and by 2040 in middle-income nations.\r\n\r\nThe group replied on December 17, 2021, that they agreed in a meeting on October 22, 2021, to end official export credit support and to tie aid support for unabated coal-fired power plants2. This ban came into force on 1 November 2021 and will be reflected in the next version of the group’s Arrangement on Officially Supported Export Credits, to be issued in early 2022. They also noted that recommendations on stopping construction of new plants, phasing out, and subsidies are not issues ‘that might be addressed or resolved by the groups working on export credits at the OECD.’ There are, however, further plans to improve due diligence screening and assessments of project applications for potential severe project-related human rights impacts in further amendments of other instruments, and the human rights experts are welcomed as stakeholders in the consultation to provide advice on how responses to potential human rights impacts could be enhanced.",

Article 2 provides a definition of ‘renewables’, and Article 14 requires that the grid companies ‘purchase all electricity generated from renewable energy sources’ and ‘provide connection service’. In this case, Gansu State Grid purchased the electricity generated by wind power and solar energy, but did not connect it to the grid. Defendant provided a strict interpretation of Article 14 that a grid company does not have a duty to put all the renewable electricity it purchases on the grid. Though under Article 29 of the same law, a grid company is responsible for failure to purchase all electricity produced from renewable sources only if such failure were to cause economic damage to the producer, FON argued for an extensive explanation of Article 29 that the defendant’s high curtailment of wind and photovoltaic power resulting in GHG emissions should have been prevented, and that the Gansu State Grid shall be held responsible for the environmental damage caused by its use of coal-fired power.\r\n\r\nOn August 14, 2018, the Lanzhou Intermediate People’s Court rejected the NGO’s claims on procedural grounds. The Court reasoned that the Gansu State Grid, because it is solely responsible for the acquisition and distribution of electricity, does not engage in activities that directly cause pollution or degradation.

It determined that the original decision would have been incompatible with the Master Plan of Islamabad. After rescinding the decision to allow commercial use of the properties, the Board issued notices to a number of property owners regarding their unsanctioned use of residential properties for commercial use. These notices were challenged by the petitioners and on February 16, 2015, the Islamabad High Court dismissed the petitions. The case was subsequently appealed to the Supreme Court.\r\n\r\nOn May 20, 2022, the Supreme Court of Pakistan issued a judgment in the case confirming the consolidated judgment of the Islamabad High Court. The Court found that the Capital Development Authority had been correct to determine that the original authorization for the conversion of the properties had been unlawful as it was not aligned with the Master Plan of Islamabad, and any deviation from that plan would have required approval by the Federal Government. The Court then went on to provide an explanation of the importance of orderly urban planning in the context of climate change. In particular the Court noted that future changes to existing urban plans would need to take climate change into account: \"It is doubtful that our early town planners were driven by climate considerations. However, climate must, in the wake of climate change, form a basic determinant of urban planning and design. Climate-resilient development in cities of all sizes is crucial for improving the well-being of people and increasing the life opportunities of future generations. Any change in the Master Plan to an urban scheme without taking account of the climate factor would be detrimental.\"\r\n\r\nThe Court went on to note that climate change can impact a number of fundamental constitutional rights, including the fundamental rights to life, dignity and property guaranteed under Articles 9, 14, 18 and 23 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973. The Court argued that including adaptation and sustainability considerations in urban planning is essential for the protection of these rights and ordered that Pakistan's urban planning authorities should take this into account in future, stating: \"The CDA shall ensure to factor in adaptation, climate resiliency and sustainability into their plans, policies and decisions in order to protect [...] constitutional rights.\"",

Earth, Adetola Onamade, Jerry Amokwandoh, Marina Tricks, and Tim Crosland filed an application at the European Court of Human Rights against the United Kingdom with a request under Rule 41 (priority). The claimants allege that, in breach of its legal obligations arising under the Human Rights Act 1998 and the European Convention on Human Rights, the UK Government is systematically failing to take practical and effective measures to address the threat from man-made climate breakdown. Articles 2, 8 and 14 of the Convention impose on governments the positive obligation to take reasonable and proportionate steps to safeguard the right to life and to family life and to do so without discrimination. That means: (i) aligning emissions reductions to the 1.5˚C Paris objective; (ii) preparing for the impacts of climate change, so far as that is possible (including by providing the public with good information); (iii) aligning public and private finance flows to the 1.5˚C Paris objective; and (iv) making the polluter pay, with effective mechanisms to ensure compensation and reparation for the victims of climate change.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, in March 2022, the UK Court of Appeal refused to hear the Claimant’s case on the basis that the Paris Agreement was irrelevant: “The fundamental difficulty which the Claimants face is that there is no authority from the European Court of Human Rights on which they can rely, citing the Paris Agreement as being relevant to the interpretation of the ECHR, Articles 2 and 8 [the rights to life and to family life]”. It also ruled that the fact that the family life of the three young people bringing the claim is inextricably linked to communities on the frontline of the crisis in the Global South was irrelevant to determining the scope of their right to family life, despite the prohibition against discrimination in safeguarding Convention rights.\r\n\r\nIn January 2023, the case was been declared inadmissible pursuant to procedure which does not involve a public decision. The Court found that the applicants were not sufficiently affected by the alleged breach of the Convention or the Protocols thereto to claim to be the victims of a violation within the meaning of Article 34 of the Convention. Accordingly, these complaints are incompatible ratione personae with the provisions of the Convention within the meaning of Article 35 § 3 (a).\r\n",

      "summary": "The parties are: \r\nAPPLICANT: Czech Republic\r\nDEFENDANT: Republic of Poland\r\nINTERVENER (in support of the applicant): European Commission\r\n\r\nThe case concerns the operation of the Turów lignite mine that supplies lignite to the 1984 megawatt Turów power plant, both owned by the Polish Energy Group (PGE). Emitting almost 10 million tons of carbon dioxide each year, the plant has been on the EU’s list of power plants with the highest negative impact on climate for years. The axis of the dispute was the negative impact on groundwater in Czech Republic. In 1994, the mine obtained a concession to extract lignite until 2020. In 2015, it requested an extension of the concession for six years. According to the Polish legislation, the extension was possible without conducting an environmental impact assessment (EIA). In March 2020, the mine received the requested prolongation until 2026. \r\n\r\nOn September 30, 2020, the Czech Republic took Poland to the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) under Article 259 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), arguing that Poland’s extension of the concession was unlawful because no EIA had been conducted, as required by EU Directive 2011/92. The applicant claimed that the Republic of Poland’s actions were unlawful by: (i) allowing the extension by 6 years of the development consent for the extraction of lignite without conducting an EIA, (ii) excluding the public from the procedure for granting the consent for extraction, (iii) declaring the EIA decision to be immediately enforceable, (iv) failing to allow the intervention of the public and of the Czech Republic in the procedure, (v) failing to enable judicial review of the mining development consent granted, (vi) failing to publish the mining development consent granted. As such, Poland has failed to fulfil its obligations under Directive 2011/92. \r\n\r\nIn February 2021, the Czech Republic asked the CJEU for interim measures, requesting the immediate closure of activities of the lignite mine. The CJEU granted the interim measures by Order of the Vice-President of the Court of 21 May 2021. However, Poland did not comply with that order. On September 20, 2021, the CJEU ordered Poland to pay the European Commission a penalty of EUR 500,000 per day from the date of notification until that Member State complies with the order. On February 3, 2022, the Court of Justice’s Advocate General (AG) Prita Pikamäe stated in his opinion that Poland had violated the EIA Directive. \r\n\r\nOn February 4, 2022, the Czech Republic informed the CJEU that as a result of the settlement reached with Poland on the dispute, it waived all claims. Consequently, the court struck the case from the register by an order of the same date. ",

      "type": "case",
      "count": 1,
      "summary": "Since the Russian Federation invaded Ukraine, the European Union has continued to import Russian oil and gas. EU imports constituted 61 percent of Russia’s fossil fuel exports (besides oil and gas also coal) in the first one hundred days of the war. Oil and gas exports are an important part of the Russian economy, the revenues of which make up 45% of Russia’s 2021 budget, according to the International Energy Agency. The imports of Russian oil and gas are governed by Regulation 2015/478 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 2015 on common rules for imports. Article 1 of that Regulation states that such oil and gas shall be freely imported into the Union and shall not be subject to any quantitative restrictions. To decrease dependence on Russian oil and gas, the European Union has adopted REPowerEU, a plan to rapidly reduce dependence on Russian fossil fuels and fast forward the green transition. The plan focuses on saving energy, diversifying energy supplies, accelerating the rollout of renewables, and smart investments. The plan has no specific timeframe to achieve its goals but aims to achieve the reduction \"as soon as possible\" and \"well before 2030,\" 2030 being the target set before the adoption of the plan. \r\n\r\nOn May 25, 2022, Global Legal Action Network (GLAN), Avaaz, Notre Affairs à Tous, Deutsche Umwelthilfe, and Svitlana Romanko, co-founder of the Stand With Ukraine campaign, filed a complaint with the European Ombudsman, Emily O’Reilly, alleging that the EU failed to conduct an impact assessment before continuing its imports from Russia after the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The complainants contend that the EU is obliged to assess the impact of its oil and gas imports on both human rights and GHG emissions. The complaint states that the EU oil and gas imports are a critical source for Russia to finance its war efforts, thus contributing to the human rights violations it says are happening in Ukraine. At the same time, the complaint states that the Commission has not adequately assessed the implications for climate change of its current and planned measures to reduce Russian oil and gas imports. The complaint mentions that the Commission’s plan to find alternatives for Russian fossil fuels risks locking in fossil fuel use.\r\n\r\nThe content of the assessments is described in detail in a letter sent on April 26, 2022, and attached to the complaint. In that letter, the complaining parties ask the Commission to:\r\n-\tassess the full range of measures that are both available to the EU – including a full cessation of imports of Russian oil and gas – appropriate to ensure that the EU does not contribute to the ability of Russia to prosecute its war of aggression in Ukraine;\r\n-\texamine – and consider other authoritative studies which examine – all available means of rapidly reducing reliance on Russian oil and gas within the EU;\r\n-\tassess the implications for the EU’s greenhouse gas emissions of any measures it considers to reduce reliance on Russian oil and gas;\r\n-\tassess how a rapid reduction in the EU’s reliance on Russian oil and gas can be achieved in a manner that is most consistent with the imperative of reducing greenhouse gas emissions.\r\n\r\nThe complaint states that the EU is obliged to respect international law in the exercise of its powers and that conducting an impact assessment is part of that obligation. In not conducting such an assessment, the EU has not acted in accordance with the principles of good administrative behavior. The complaint specifically mentions that the EU has violated art. 6 (proportionality) and 9 (objectivity) of the European Code of Good Administrative Behavior. \r\n\r\nAfter receiving the complaint, it is up to the Ombudsman’s office to determine whether the complaint warrants an inquiry. If the Ombudsman opens an inquiry, she can find that (1) there is no maladministration, (2) make a proposal to the institution to resolve the matter, or (3) find that there is maladministration and make recommendations to address the maladministration. The Commission then has three months to respond. \r\n",

The applicant sued the National Offshore Petroleum Safety and Environmental Management Authority (NOPSEMA), the Australian Government’s offshore energy regulator, and an oil and gas company, Santos Limited, over the approval of plans to drill the Barossa gas field in waters off Northern Australia. The applicant claimed that NOPSEMA did not have jurisdiction because the requisite consultations with the applicant were carried out. \r\n\r\nProceedings regarding an application for an interlocutory injunction restraining Santos from commencing or continuing offshore drilling until the expedited final hearing, which was scheduled for six weeks after the proceedings for interlocutory relief, commenced on July 13, 2022. After accepting that the applicant had demonstrated a prima facie case, the injunction was denied on the basis that drilling will not have gotten underway to a significant extent by the time the hearing came about and of earlier representations made by the applicant indicating he was prepared to accept harm occasioned by the drilling of one well over a short period in order to be availed of the opportunity to stop the vast majority of the approved drilling at an expedited hearing.\r\n\r\nIn a decision issued on September 21, 2022, the Federal Court of Australia found that NOPSEMA was not lawfully satisfied that consultation had occurred.

The case is supported by Instituto Internacional Arayara de Educação e Cultura (Instituto Internacional Arayara) as amicus curiae. The case questions the constitutionality of articles 1 to 7 of Federal Law 14,299/2022, which establishes an economic subsidy to small-scale public service concessionaires and creates the Just Energy Transition Program (TEJ). The applicants claim that the articles extend the contracting of electricity generated by the Jorge Lacerda Thermoelectric Complex (CTJL) with subsidies from consumers for another 15 years from 2025, which includes the purchase of energy from the burning of coal and fossil fuels. Considering that the CTJL is the largest emitter of greenhouse gases (GHG) in the southern region of Brazil, the applicants allege that there is a violation of the Federal Constitution and the Paris Agreement (enacted by Federal Decree 9.073/2017), as well as the National Policy on Climate Change - PNMC (Federal Law 12,187/2009). They emphasize that the use of coal for energy generation is responsible for socio-environmental disasters in the region, exacerbation of climate change and damage to public health, especially in relation to populations that are already subject to socioeconomic disadvantages. They argue that the TEJ makes it possible to extend the operation of the CTJL until at least 2040. Further, the norm has not presented guidelines for the reduction of GHG by the Complex. On the contrary, the TEJ stated that there will be no abatement of carbon dioxide. Finally, the applicants argue that the composition established for the TEJ Council violates the principles of participatory democracy and equality, as there is no equalization of the number of seats allocated to government and civil society organizations and its composition does not reflect the participation of actors related to environmental and labor causes and the sustainable closure of mines. As a precautionary measure, the plaintiffs request that the Law is interpreted according to the Constitution, so that they are considered unconstitutional. Further, that the the subsidy established by the Law is suspended and declared unconstitutional, suspending the effects of articles 4, 5, 6 and 7 of the Law. The plaintiffs request, as a final measure, that the Court (i) gives an interpretation in accordance with the Constitution to articles 1, 2 and 3, considering them unconstitutional and prohibited the granting of the subsidy under the terms of the Law and (ii) that articles 4 to 7 of Federal Law 14,299/2022 be declared unconstitutional.",

These norms establish the criteria and requirements to perform fracking in Colombia. The petitioner argued that the challenged norms allowed fracking in Colombia, despite the significant number of scientific studies that substantiate fracking’s adverse and irreversible effects on human health and environmental stability. \r\n\r\nOn July 7, 2022, the Council of State decided against the plaintiffs’ claims. The court found that there was no violation of the Constitution or Law 99 of 1993 and declared the challenged norms valid. The court considered that fracking was already authorized by other existing and valid norms and that the challenged acts were merely contributing to its regulation. The court reasoned that all fracking-related norms should be interpreted holistically and comprehensively, preventing the court from declaring, as argued by the plaintiff, that the challenge acts were insufficient or inadequate. The court decided that the challenged acts complemented the criteria and requirement to perform fracking. The court restricted the legal analysis to the possible contradiction of superior norms that could undermine the validity of the acts. However, the court concluded that this contradiction was not proved during trial.\r\n\r\nThe court explicitly invoked the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, among other norms, and stated that the precautionary principle is crucial for the protection of the climate system in benefit of future and present generations. Moreover, the decision mentions that according to the expert witnesses and reports, fracking, and fossil fuel exploitation in general prevent Colombia from reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and contributing to the fight against climate change. Nevertheless, the court considered the challenged acts did not violate this principle. According to the court, the precautionary principle does not mean “zero risk scenarios”, rather controlled scenarios to reach environmental and economic development goals. In the court’s opinion, the challenged acts are part of a broader set of norms that regulate fracking in Colombia in a way that does not contradict any superior norm. ",

      "id": "Smith v. Attorney-General",
      "type": "case",
      "count": 1,
      "summary": "In March 2022, the plaintiff, a Māori elder, landowner, and tribal climate spokesperson, brought a claim against New Zealand’s government, alleging “inadequate action in relation to climate change”. He argued that the successive New Zealand governments had failed to adequately address the effects of climate change on New Zealand and its citizens, especially Māori. Specifically, the plaintiff argued that the government had failed to incorporate international obligations into domestic law, and to reduce the carbon emissions produced by government activities. Furthermore, although the government had introduced an emissions trading scheme, the plaintiff argued that the overall emissions cap was set too high and contained unjustifiable exemptions. \r\n\r\nThe claim was based on three legal grounds: (1) rights protected under New Zealand’s statutory Bill of Rights Act (NZBORA), specifically the rights to life and culture; (2) obligations allegedly owed under the Treaty of Waitangi | Te Tiriti o Waitangi (including possible fiduciary duties); and (3) rights protected under New Zealand’s common law (including the public trust doctrine). First, the plaintiff alleged that the New Zealand government had breached the rights guaranteed under sections 8 and 20 of the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990 (NZBORA), namely the rights to life and the rights of minorities. Second, the plaintiff alleged that the New Zealand government had failed to act in accordance with its obligations under te Tiriti o Waitangi | the Treaty of Waitangi (Te Tiriti), New Zealand’s founding document. The defendant applied for the claims to be struck out. Third, the plaintiff argued that the government owed (and had breached) a common law duty of care to New Zealanders to “take all necessary steps to reduce NZ emissions and to actively protect the plaintiff and his descendants from the adverse effects of climate change.” \r\n\r\nIn July 2022, the New Zealand’s High Court struck out all three claims as untenable. First, it found that the common law duty of care lacked reference to any recognized legal obligations, and went beyond mere incremental development of new obligations. Furthermore, it was beyond the democratic role and institutional competence of a Court to “monitor” the full scope of the government’s climate change response. Next, the Court found that the right to life claim was untenable because the plaintiff had not pointed to a “real and identifiable” risk to a specified individual. Furthermore, the minority rights claim had failed to particularize specific breaches, NZBORA s 20 does not impose positive duties on the State, and that the Crown had taken adequate steps to consider the interests of Māori. Finally, the Court found that Te Tiriti does not give rise to free-standing obligations, and that plaintiff’s claim was too wide-ranging to give rise to fiduciary Te Tiriti obligations because such obligations would untenably be owed to the public in general. Even if such duties were to be developed, they would need to rely on the common law duty advanced in the first cause of action, which the Court deemed untenable in any event.\r\n\r\nIn 2024, New Zealand’s Court of Appeal upheld the High Court’s decision. The Court of Appeal accepted that it might be plausible that “an inadequate response” to climate change could be challenged under NZBORA. However, the Court found that Smith's particular claim was untenable. This was because it challenged a comprehensive piece of legislation, New Zealand’s Climate Change Response Act (CCRA), rather than specific decisions made under it. The framework itself “reflect[s] policy choices that are for Parliament,” not the courts. Secondly, the Court of Appeal found the plaintiff’s Treaty of Waitangi claims to be “clearly untenable.” It concluded that the present case was ill-suited to considering whether legislation could be declared inconsistent with the Treaty of Waitangi, partly because the challenged CCRA already integrated Treaty-related obligations. Likewise, the claimed fiduciary duty was too broad and general. Finally, the Court rejected the plaintiff’s common law claim. In addition to similar reasons for striking out the first two claims, the Court concluded that the public trust doctrine obligations alleged by the plaintiff were too broad and displaced by legislation.\r\n\r\nNote: The same plaintiff also brought a claim against New Zealand’s seven largest greenhouse gas emitters, based in tort law. That case, Smith v Fonterra, has a separate database entry.",

      "count": 1,
      "summary": "On August 12, 2021, three natural persons, an Austrian municipality, and the NGO Global 2000 applied to the Minister for Digitalization and Business Location. They demanded issuing an ordinance that establishes a gradual ban on the sale of fossil fuels in Austria. The sale of solid fossil fuels should be banned from 1 January 2025, the sale of fossil heating oil from 1 January 2030, the sale of fossil fuels from 1 January 2035, and the sale of fossil fuels for aviation from 1 January 2040. In support of their claim, the applicants argued that they were directly affected by the climate crisis, which mainly results from burning fossil fuels - a practice that needs to be halted to protect life, health, and the environment. \r\nOne of the applicants asserted that climate change-induced heat waves posed a significant health risk due to pre-existing conditions; another applicant brought forward that she would severely suffer from the impacts of climate change due to her young age. The applicant municipality, in turn, stated that due to its location in the Alpine region, it was exposed to a significant risk of landslides during heavy rainfall events, which endangered the lives and health of its citizens. The fourth applicant, a farmer, argued that climate change-induced drought and resulting crop failures endangered her livelihood and caused ecological harm. \r\n\r\nThe applicants relied on EU Secondary Law, fundamental rights, and the Austrian Trade Regulation Act to support their claim:\r\nThe Minister should rely on Art 69 of the Austrian Trade Regulations Act to issue the demanded sales ban. The latter provision authorizes the Minister to determine measures tradespeople shall take regarding the goods they produce or sell to avoid risks to health and life or environmental pollution. According to the applicants, the Minister could, for example, prohibit operators of petrol stations from selling fossil fuels by relying on Art 69 Trade Regulations Act. \r\nThe applicants further argued that their right to request the above-mentioned sales ban grounds in EU Secondary Law and fundamental rights. The EU’s Effort Sharing Regulation (2018/842) sets binding GHG reduction targets for its Member States - according to the applicants, it aims at protecting the life and health of European citizens and thus confers subjective rights to them. European citizens may thus demand “their” member state to comply with EU reduction targets and adopt respective measures. The applicants supported their claim by relying on earlier case law regarding air pollution control in which the European Court of Justice recognized a subjective right to require issuing an ordinance in case of exceedance of limit values. (See Janacek v. Bayern, ECLI:EU:C:2008:447, ClientEarth v. The Secretary of State for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, ECLI:EU:C:2013:805). \r\nIn addition, the applicants derived their right to demand the issuance of an ordinance from fundamental rights, in particular Art 2 and 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which oblige the state to take measures against climate change. \r\n\r\nIn the first instance, the Federal Minister dismissed the application for lack of competence. In her decision, the Minister argued that the requested measure, namely a transition from fossil to clean energy, was not covered by its constitutional competences, and that she was thus not authorized to issue the requested ordinance. According to the Minister, Art 69 of the Austrian Trade Regulation Act only concerns the prevention of threats specific to the trade and industry sector. It cannot be invoked for higher-level objectives such as the transition to green energy. \r\n\r\nIn the second instance, the administrative court of Vienna addressed whether the plaintiffs could demand the enactment of an ordinance on the phasing out of fossil fuels. The court held that the Effort Sharing Regulation is directed at EU Member States and that subjective rights could principally arise from the regulatory content of the regulation. However, the regulation’s wording does not show the European legislator’s intent to grant EU citizens subjective rights. Therefore, the applicants are not entitled to demand compliance with the Effort Sharing Regulation or the enactment of the proposed ordinance. \r\nRegarding fundamental rights, the court held that legislative and administrative inaction could not be challenged and that it was not competent to order an administrative authority to issue an ordinance. Furthermore, positive obligations arising from fundamental rights only apply to localized natural disasters and hazards. The applicants could not demand the enactment of an ordinance for phasing out fossil fuels based on fundamental rights. \r\n\r\nIn the last instance, the Constitutional Court dismissed the complaint. The court did not find a violation of the applicants’ right to their lawful judge as a decision on the merits was rightfully denied by lower instances: The administrative court of Vienna had rightly concluded that a subjective right to demand the issuing of ordinances could not be derived from the EU Effort Sharing Regulation. Further, fundamental rights do not require granting a right to demand the issuing of ordinance based on Art 69 Trade Regulations Act. Fundamental rights, particularly Art 2 and 8 of the European Convention of Human Rights, give rise to positive obligations in case of severe environmental threats. The state enjoys a wide margin of discretion in fulfilling its positive obligations; a violation only occurs if suitable measures are missing entirely or if the measures adopted are not suitable to achieve the objective pursued. \r\nFundamental rights do not entail the applicants’ right to demand the issuing of an ordinance. Hence, their claim was dismissed. ",

This accident led to a lengthy criminal investigation against the master of the vessel. The criminal claims were accompanied by civil liability claims, which were brought by several legal persons, including the Spanish State, against the master and owners of the Prestige and the London P&I Club, the insurer of the ship and its owners. These civil liability claims were grouped and resolved by the criminal court in a single procedure. The Supreme Court applied the rules applicable to environmental accidents regulated in the international conventions CLC92 and IOPC Funds and stated that the defendants were liable and should pay an amount of compensation for damages, depending on their level of responsibility in the environmental disaster. \r\n\r\nIn its ruling of 2016, the Supreme Court determined the bases for assessing the damages, including consequential damages, loss of profits and moral damages caused \"not only by the feeling of fear, anger and frustration that affected a large part of Spanish and French citizens,\" but also by \"the indelible imprint of the perception that catastrophes of this or greater magnitude can affect the same injured parties at any time.\" The determination of the indemnities was subsequently established by the provincial court of La Coruña, by order of the Supreme Court.\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court applied both an objective and subjective test to establish liability for damages. By the objective test, the court ruled that the International Oil Pollution Compensation Funds (IOPC Funds) must pay part of the damages up to the economic ceiling it had to bear in accordance with its own rules. For the remaining damages to be compensated, the court applied the fault-based liability test, condemning the ship's master for gross negligence, on the basis of he acted \"with intent to cause such damage or recklessly and with knowledge that such damage would probably be caused.\" It also convicted the shipowner for \"extraneous acts\" as two requirements were met: (1) that there is a relationship of dependence between the perpetrator and the principal, whether a natural or legal person, for whom he works; and (2) that the perpetrator acts within the scope of his duties, albeit in excess of his duties\". The court also found that the shipowner acted with conscious and deliberate disregard of the serious environmental risks involved in its actions, and therefore capable of invalidating the shipowner's right of limitation under the CLC92 by its own terms”. Finally, the insurer had to assume the amount of civil liability it was entitled to under the insurance contract.\r\n\r\nBy order of November 15, 2017, the Audiencia Provincial de La Coruña (Regional Court of La Coruña, Spain) set out the amounts that each of the claimants was entitled to obtain from the respective defendants. In 2018, the Supreme Court upheld in part and rejected in part the appeal filed by the defendants in 2018 in relation to the amount of compensation referred to in the ruling of the Provincial\r\nCourt in 2017.",

      "summary": "The General Law on Climate Change in Mexico was issued in 2012. This law contemplated the Climate Change Fund, a public trust fund created to increase the existing resources to address climate change. According to article 80 of the Law, it had the objective of attracting and channeling public, private, national, and international financial resources to support the implementation of actions to address climate change. However, in 2020 the Mexican Congress reformed the Law and eliminated the Climate Change Fund. \r\n \r\nOn December 17, 2020, the Mexican Center for Environmental Law (CEMDA) filed a complaint against the amendments, arguing among others, that it violates the constitutional right to a healthy environment. The plaintiff requested an injunction to suspend the effects of the amendments, asking the Court to stop the elimination of the Fund. The injunction was denied.\r\n \r\n However, the Judge considered that the reform did not restrict the exercise of any right. The Judge argued that the reform did not disappear the funds to address climate change, it only reallocated the resources on to the Federal Expenditure Budget. Therefore, the Court decided the case against CEMDA, considering it did not violate the right to a healthy environment. CEMDA appealed the decision before a Collegiate Tribunal. \r\n\r\nIn August 2021, the Tribunal decided, due to the relevance of the case, to send the appeal the Mexican Supreme Court. The Supreme Court’s decision is still pending.\r\n\r\nOn April 12, 2023, the Supreme Court decided that it is not up to the judges to evaluate whether a public policy, in a broad sense, is suitable to fulfill a specific purpose, since these decisions correspond to the executive and legislative branches of government. Considering that the modification of the strategy to combat climate change (to extinguish the Climate Change Fund and transfer that budget directly assigned to the Environmental Secretariat) is a matter of public policy, this modification cannot be analyzed by judges. Legislators have ample freedom to determine the mechanisms they deem appropriate to direct the policy to combat climate change. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, it was determined that it was not demonstrated that the Fund’s resources, after the modification, will not be used in a correct, transparent and equitable manner.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the Judge’s decision was confirmed, and the claim was denied.",

      "summary": "On September 5, 2022, environmental organization Deutsche Umwelthilfe (DUH; Environmental Action Germany) filed a lawsuit against the German government in the Higher Administrative Court of Berlin-Brandenburg. \r\n\r\nThe case challenges the “Sofortprogramm” (immediate action program) presented by the Federal Ministry of Digital and Transport. § 8 of the Federal Climate Change Act (KSG) requires federal government ministries to draft immediate action programs where the emissions in their respective sectors have exceeded the permissible annual emissions budget. These plans are to demonstrate compliance with the annual sectoral emission budgets for the following years. Any immediate action program is to be presented to the Council of Experts on Climate Change which is tasked with assessing and examining “the assumptions on greenhouse gas reduction that underlie the measures.” (§ 12(2) KSG). \r\n\r\nIn its consideration of the Transport Ministry’s immediate action program, the Council of Experts found that the measures suggested in the immediate action program were not sufficient to comply with § 8 (1) KSG. It calculated the cumulative emissions gap to amount to 261 million tons CO2-equivalent by 2030. On the basis of these findings and its own calculations, DUH is arguing for the short-term enforcement of an immediate action programme that complies with the (CO2) requirements of the Federal Climate Change Act. \r\n\r\nIn its submission to the court, DUH outlines several measures and their calculated emissions reductions that could, they submit, be included in an immediate climate action program:\r\n1) 100/80/30 speed limits on highways/outside of cities/in cities\r\n2) Reduction of climate damaging subsidies for, amongst others, diesel and company cars\r\n3) Introduction of a CO2-based new registration tax\r\n4) Nationwide 365€ ticket and rapid expansion of local public transport and rail \r\n5) Mileage-based passenger car toll\r\n6) Moratorium on new construction and expansion of federal road network \r\n7) Adaptation of the Road Traffic Act and Road Traffic Regulations to reflect climate and environmental considerations \r\n",

      "count": 1,
      "summary": "On April 3, 2019, GABRIËLS & CO l.c. requested an environmental permit to build and exploit a new gas station in Boechout, a municipality of Belgium located in the Flemish province of Antwerp. The process for obtaining such a permit includes a public inquiry, during which 51 objections to the project were raised. The municipal authority refused to deliver the permit to the requesting company on the basis of the fact that the envisaged gas station was not “future proof” in that it did not include a recharge point for electric cars nor did it provide for compressed natural gas. \r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the local authorities of Boechout adopted a “2020 charter” to become a climate neutral municipality, following which they established a climate action program. According to this program, enterprises with an establishment in Boechout need to contribute toward this goal; the project of GABRIËLS & CO, on the contrary, violates the action program.\r\n\r\nGABRIËLS & CO l.c. started a procedure in appeal again the refusal decision. Once more, the local authorities rendered a negative decision, confirming their standpoint. Similarly, the provincial environment officer gave a negative advice for the project. However, the provincial government, on appeal, eventually decided that the project should receive an environmental permit on the ground that the reason used by the local authorities to refuse to deliver the permit is illegal.\r\n\r\nAfter the permit was delivered, prospective neighbors of the envisioned gas station sought to suspend and annul the environmental permit before the Council for Permit Disputes, a special administrative tribunal under Belgian law.\r\n\r\nIn the course of the suspension procedure, the Council found that Art. 4.3.4 of the Flemish Code for Spatial Planning is an optional ground for refusal for projects that are not compatible with the objectives and duties of care of the local authority concerned. The Council decided that the environmental permit was not carefully motivated because there was no research on whether the project would be compatible with the environmental objectives of the community of Boechout or whether mitigating measures would be sufficient to compensate the negative advice of the community of Boechout. On this ground, the Council suspended the decision of the provincial government on April 22, 2021. \r\n\r\nIn the primary procedure, which sought to annul the permit, the Council found on December 9, 2021, that there was insufficient justification with regard to the gas station’s compatibility with the residential area in which it was to be built and with its immediate surroundings; such compatibility is an important component of “good spatial planning,” and, as such, suffices as a ground to refuse to deliver an environmental permit. (As is common practice in Belgian law, the Council only discussed this plea, which is in itself was sufficient to annul the decision to deliver the permit, and ignored the other arguments of the plaintiffs.)\r\n\r\nThis case is indicative of the growing tendency under (Flemish) Belgian environmental law to assess environmental permit requests in light of climate objectives such as climate neutrality. Such assessment is mandated on the part of local authorities in the context of their general duty to practice “good spatial planning.”\r\n",

The plaintiffs request that Russian authorities take measures that will reduce the country’s greenhouse gas emissions, in line with the targets of limiting the global temperature rise to 1.5 °C agreed under the 2015 Paris Agreement. Russia is currently the fourth biggest producer of carbon emissions worldwide, and needs to reduce 31% of its 1991 levels to meet the 2030 goal of the Paris Accords. The plaintiffs contend that Russia’s insufficient measures on climate change are “violating the Russian constitution and the European convention on human rights”. Russia would withdraw from the ECHR on Friday, 16 September, which means the climate lawsuit would be among the last cases in the country that the ECHR could issue a binding agreement on, if it is taken to the European courts. The court denied the application on September 21, and it was subsequently submitted to the European Court of Human Rights.\r\n\r\nProceedings with the European Court of Human Rights are currently pending.

The complainants claimed that climate change has caused the complainants to face life-threatening hazards, reduced physical and mental well-being, increased health risks, food and water insecurity, along with disruption to their education and livelihoods. The complainants stated that they had experienced various impacts caused by climate change including 1) heat waves that caused death and heat-related illness and decreased productivity of outdoor works; 2) sea level rise which causes coral reef bleaching and declining fish stocks, causing food and job insecurity in tourism and fisheries; 3) an increase in extreme heat and rainfall brings disease, water and food insecurity; 4) the occurrence of tidal flooding, high waves, and strong winds due to sea level rise endangering lives and causing loss of shelter and vulnerability to food and water; and 5) complainants' aggravated mental health.\r\n\r\nThe complainants claim that the Indonesian government has violated their human rights guaranteed by the Indonesian constitution, by not taking the necessary mitigation and adaptation measures to prevent temperature rises above 1.5 degrees. The claim came from the fact that: 1) Indonesia is still heavily dependent on deforestation and fossil fuels, especially coal for economic growth; 2) Indonesia has inadequate emission reduction targets; 3) Indonesia still allocates significant available resources to support carbon-intensive industries; 4) Indonesia does not integrate adaptation planning into domestic policies and budgeting 5) Indonesia fails to ensure that social protection mechanisms work to reduce vulnerability to disasters and climate-related stresses; and 6) Indonesia does not prioritize nature-based adaptation. The complaint alleges that Indonesia government’s insufficient action on climate change has violated the following rights under Indonesia constitution: 1) the right to life and the right to a good and healthy environment, 2) the right to develop oneself through the fulfillment of basic needs, 3) the right to food and water, 4) the right to education, 5) the right to work and earn a decent living, and 6) children's rights.",

      "summary": "In August 12, 2021, the Mexican Center for Environmental Law (CEMDA) and Greenpeace challenged a series of regulations that involved the setting of tariffs for renewable energy projects under legacy contracts. By an order of the District Court, the suit was divided in multiple trials due to the number and scope of the different regulations that were challenged.  Among them, the plaintiffs challenged the Agreement and its Annex to guarantee the efficiency, quality, reliability, continuity, and security of the National Electric System in light of the SARS-CoV2 (COVID 19) pandemic, emitted by the National Center for Energy Control (CENACE). The Agreement established that that the intermittency of renewable energy projects jeopardized the reliability of the National Electric System. As such, it ordered CENACE to limit the operation of intermittent energy projects and to suspend and reject pre-operational trials of intermittent wind and photovoltaic power plants in the process of commercial operation.\r\n\r\nThe plaintiffs considered that the Agreement violated the right to a healthy environment, enshrined in the Mexican Constitution, since it prevented the participation of renewable energy projects in the electric market which would lead to an increase in GHG emissions which contribute to climate change. Plaintiffs also argued that the Agreement prevents achieving an energy transition, as well as Mexico’s international commitments to address climate change since it imposes restrictions on renewable energy projects.  \r\n\r\nOn April 19, 2021, the Second District Court in Administrative Matters Specialized in Antitrust, Broadcasting and Telecommunications ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, concluding that CENACE did not have the authority to emit the Agreement and that it transgressed the individual and collective dimensions of the right to a healthy environment enshrined in the Constitution and several international treaties. On one hand, more GHG emissions would have an impact on human health. On the other hand, the court considered that the Agreement would prevent Mexico from fulfilling its commitments under the Paris Agreement, Kyoto Protocol and United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change since it limited privileged electricity generated by fossil fuels over renewable energy projects. Thus, even if there was no certainty of the degree of the risk or harm that the Agreement would cause, a proper application of the precautionary principle demands that the regulation is struck down.  The Court also emphasized that in these cases, there is a reversal of the burden of proof, which forced authorities to prove that the Agreement would not cause any environmental damage. Finally, the court considered that the Agreement was contrary to the progressive nature of environmental protection envisaged by the Mexican legal system, which limited the possibility of unjustifiably reducing or modifying any already achieved level of protection. This was the case since the 2015 the Energy Transition Act orders authorities to set goals so that electricity consumption is increasingly satisfied by economically viable clean energy sources. The Act orders a minimum of 25% of the demand for electricity satisfied by clean energy sources by 2018; 30% by 2021, and 35% by 2024. \r\n\r\nThe authorities appealed the decision but the First Circuit Court in Administrative Matters Specialized in Antitrust, Broadcasting and Telecommunications dismissed the appeal. \r\n\r\nOn November 4, 2021, the First Circuit Collegiate Tribunal, who heard the appeal, decided to reverse the Court's decision and dismiss the case. \r\n\r\nThe Tribunal decided this because on March 4, 2021 CENACE declared the challenged agreement and the policy null and void. The National Center of Energy Control determined to leave such regulations null and void, in compliance with a different amparo trial, where the Judge in that case considered that these regulations were unconstitutional for violating the right to economic competition. Therefore, the present case was dismissed, because the challenged regulations ceased to have effect. ",

      "summary": "The Mexican Center for Environmental Law (CEMDA) challenged the Mexican Electricity Commission’s resolution increasing legacy transmission rates that affect renewable energy projects. Legacy energy projects refer to those energy projects that are regulated by the legal regime that existed prior to Mexico’s 2014 energy reform. Under such regimes, energy projects receive special transmission rates, among other features. In the challenged resolution, the Mexican Electricity Commission increased the transmission rates that such projects must pay by between 500% and 800%, according to CEMDA.\r\n\r\nPlaintiff considered that the new transmission rates transgress Mexico’s international commitments on environmental and energy matters. They also highlighted that the increase in the rates is unjustified, disproportionate and will hamper Mexico’s transition to clean energy sources. Finally, they considered that the obstruction of clean energy sources through the increased rates constitutes a violation of the right to a healthy environment since it will lead to an increased dependence on fossil fuels. \r\n\r\nThe First District Court in Administrative Matters Specialized in Antitrust, Broadcasting and Telecommunications granted a stay of the implementation of the price increase in October 2020 pending the final decision of the trial. In the decision to stay the new rates, the District Court considered that the new transmission rates could signify an increase in greenhouse gas emissions that jeopardize human health, thus potentially infringing in the right to a healthy environment. \r\n\r\nIn December 2021, the Third District Court in Administrative Matters Specialized in Antitrust, Broadcasting, and Telecommunications was created by the Federal Judiciary Council, and the case was reassigned to it under the number 232/2021. \r\n\r\nOn May 15, 2023 the Judge decided that the plaintiff, as an NGO, did not have legal standing to file the lawsuit because the plaintiff did not offer evidence that would allow to affirm that the challenged acts affect the environment. Furthermore, the Court considered that even though the civil organization has, as its purpose, the legal defense of the right to a healthy environment, this is not enough to prove its legal standing. Therefore, the case was dismissed.\r\n\r\nOn June 2, 2023, CEMDA challenged the Court’s decision. On July 25, 2024, the Collegiate Court solved the appeal and confirmed the District Court’s decision.

In its suit, Greenpeace also asked for a stay of the implementation of both regulations. Plaintiff argued that the regulations displace the use of renewable energy sources in electricity generation in favor of polluting, fossil fuel sources. This transgresses Mexico’s international commitments on climate change. \r\n\r\nThe First District Court in Administrative Matters Specialized in Antitrust, Broadcasting and Telecommunications granted a stay of the implementation of both the Act and PRODESEN. The court agreed with the plaintiffs in considering that the regulation could potentially transgress the right to a healthy environment by stalling the energy transition. \r\n\r\nThe stay was appealed by the authorities. On September 1, 2022, the First Circuit Court in Administrative Matters Specialized in Antitrust, Broadcasting and Telecommunications overturned the district court’s decision, denying the stay.

In this sense, the harm was not sufficiently immediate to grant the stay. \r\n\r\nOn January 9, 2023, the District Court ruled on the merits in favor of Greenpeace.

On this day, the activists of ANV-COP21 seized 4 official portraits of President Macron to denounce the climate inaction under his presidency. Brandishing banners that read \"Climate, social justice: where is Macron?,\" the activists then launched a call to multiply the campaign throughout the country. Arrests of climate protesters began the following day. On August 25, 2019, the \"March of the portraits\" for the climate brought together more than 900 people in Bayonne despite the ban on demonstrations during the G7. In the center of Bayonne, official portraits of President Macron sought by police forces resurfaced with the head facing down. A press conference drew up a severe assessment of the Macron government's climate policy and denounced the huge gap between his international speeches on climate and concrete actions in France. Nearly 100 journalists, including many foreign media experts, covered the march and the press conference given by several personalities and climate specialists.\r\n\r\nSince the first demonstration, activists have taken 151 Macron’s official portraits off city halls around the country, resulting in 86 searches and 1467 cumulative hours in police custody for 128 activists. 88 people were summoned in 56 trials, facing up to 5 years in prison and a fine of up to 75,000 euros. Most of the demonstrators were discharged on the merits in the name of the state of necessity and freedom of expression. For example, in September 2019, two activists prosecuted for the robbery of a portrait of Emmanuel Macron obtained an acquittal from the Lyon High Court, in the name of the state of necessity. The judgment recognized the insufficiency of public policies to address the climate crisis and the legitimacy of portrait removal actions in a “broken democracy”. In September 2020, three new acquittals were granted by courts in Auch, Strasbourg, and Valence courts, where judges held that condemning the activists would be an attack on freedom of expression. In Valence, the court added that the state of necessity is established by the existence of imminent danger and the absence of disproportion between the means employed and the seriousness of the threat, therefore deciding that unhooking Macron’s portraits to denounce his climate inaction is an act of general interest. The prosecutor's office systematically appealed the acquittals.\r\n\r\nOn September 22, 2021, the Court of Cassation rejected the state of necessity, but overturned the conviction of eight activists in Bordeaux, holding that unhooking presidential portraits can be a form of expression and that courts must justify that a conviction would not be a disproportionate infringement on freedom of expression. The court also recognized that DNA sampling of some activists was excessive for this type of non-violent action. ",

      "summary": "The company ‘EDF Production Électrique Insulaire’ intended to replace an old thermal power plant in French Guiana, France’s overseas region, which, due to its obsolescence and future compliance with regulatory standards, had to be shut down by December 31, 2023. A decree dated March 30, 2017, set forth the replacement of the thermal power plant by a new thermal power plant; the operation of this power by EDF was authorised by an order of the territorial authority on June 13th, 2017. By two orders dated October 22, 2020, the Prefect of French Guiana issued an environmental authorization for a new oil-fired thermal power plant construction project to proceed and a building licence. \r\n\r\nOn July 7, 2021, two environmental organizations (Guyane Nature Environnement and France Nature Environnement) requested the suspension of the environmental authorization to the interim relief judge (juge des référés) of the administrative court of French Guyana. On July 27, 2021 and September 7, 2021, the judge of the administrative court granted the request and suspended the authorization considering that there were serious doubts about the legality of the authorization. The suspension was based on: (i) the objectives of reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions defined by law (-40% between 1990 and 2030), and (ii) the provisions of the urban planning code relating to the limited extension of urban development in areas close to the shoreline.\r\n\r\nOn August 11th, 2021, the Minister of Ecological Transition and EDF Production Électrique Insulaire asked the Council of State to overturn the suspension of work of the future power plant. On February 10th, 2022, the Council of State granted these requests and overturned the suspension of the Larivot power plant environmental authorization decided by the interim relief judge of the administrative court of French Guyana. The Council of State considered that there was no legal requirement to take into account the national energy policy objective of reducing GHG emissions by 40% between 1990 and 2030, as set out in article L. 100-4 of the Energy Code, for authorizations that do not relate to the operating of a power plant producing electricity using fossil fuels. \r\n\r\nThe decision is based on the distinction between the conditions of issuance of an environmental authorization and the conditions of issuance of an authorization to operate the plant. The environmental organizations have contested the environmental authorization on the ground of breach of article L. 100-4 of the Energy Code. However, environmental authorizations must comply with the objectives of reducing GHG emissions as set forth in article L. 100-4 only in specific cases, and this was not one of them since it did not entail the authorization to operate the plant (which had been previously granted). \r\n\r\nWith regards to article L.121-40 of the French Urbanization Code and the limited extension of urban development near coastlines, the Council of State held that the provision only applies to decisions authorizing urban developments. Therefore, the provision is not applicable to environmental authorizations, the purpose of which is not to authorize the construction of one or more facilities, but rather to authorize the future operation of such facility. The Council of State applied the principle of independence of legislation.\r\n\r\nOn April 28, the administrative court of Cayenne has annulled the environmental authorization, stating that, even though the project of construction of a power station has to be considered as of major public interest, it is not proved that the two zones of the site known as the «future park» at Rémire-Montjoly do not constitute satisfactory alternatives to the Larivot site for the location of the EDF-PEI power plant, making it possible to limit the damage caused to protected species. Therefore, it ensues that considering that there was no satisfactory solution other than the one chosen by the petitioner for the siting of the power plant at the Larivot site, the prefect incorrectly applied the provisions of 4° of Art. L. 411-2 of the environmental code.\r\n\r\nEDF and the Ministry appealed this decision and the Administrative Court of Appeal of Bordeaux, on June 2022 suspended the decision of the annulment of the environmental authorization granted to EDF.\r\n\r\nMoreover, on July 18, 2022 the administrative court of Guyana issued the final decisions, which focus on the building license, and annulled such license, affirming that it does not respect the provisions of the urban planning code. More precisely, the administrative court affirmed that the Larivot site constitutes a characteristic site of the natural heritage of Guyana's coastline, sheltering an environment necessary for maintaining biological balance. As a result, the court considered that, given that the site chosen to host the power plant constitutes a characteristic site of the natural heritage of Guyana's coastline, the authorization failed to comply with the provisions of the town planning code. Moreover, the court affirmed that the environmental impact study carried out by EDF the French electricity company was vitiated by substantial shortcomings in the comparison of the environmental impacts of the various alternative sites envisaged by the project owner for the location of the power plant.\r\n\r\nAs a result of these two irregularities, the administrative court annulled the building permit issued to EDF-PEI for the construction of a power plant on the Larivot site. The administrative court rejected the other requests of the claimants, asking for the cancellation of the prefectural orders concerning the construction of a fuel transport pipeline over 14 kilometers between the port of Dégrad-des-Cannes and the power station of Larivot.\r\n\r\nEDF-Pei and the Ministry of Ecological Transition have appealed also this decision, claiming for a suspension of the enforcement of the judgment. \r\n\r\nOn October 7, 2022 the administrative court of appeal of Bordeaux suspended the decision of the annulment of the building permit granted in 2020 to EDF for this power station. In its preliminary judgement, it considers that the French group has submitted to the public inquiry an environmental impact study which assesses the different possible alternatives and that the site of the power plant is not part of remarkable natural areas. \r\n",

      "summary": "The Centre for Protection against Unfair Competition sued a fossil and oil dealer in relation to an advertising on ‘climate neutral premium heating oil’, arguing that it posed a misleading commercial practice, and additionally, that it was misleading by omission.\r\n\r\nThe Regional Court of Constance denied that the claim was misleading pursuant to § 5 para. 1 of the Act against Unfair Competition because the plaintiff had not sufficiently substantiated the misleading nature of the claim. However, the Court upheld the action on the grounds of a violation of §5a para. 2 because the plaintiff had omitted essential information.\r\n\r\nThe Regional Court held that the plaintiff omitted essential information by not connecting the statements in the advertising with information on how the advertised climate neutrality of the heating oil was achieved. It reiterated the strict standard applicable to environment-related advertising claims. The court emphasised that it was essential for the defendant's customers to know if climate neutrality was achieved through energy reductions in their own operations, the partial use of renewable energies or the acquisition of certificates. The Regional Court highlighted that reductions would be considered as more important than the mere acquisition of certificates due to the company’s significantly higher efforts and increased sustainability. In order to make an informed business decision, the customer needed information on how climate neutrality was achieved. The Regional Court also assumed that customers would be willing to pay more if climate neutrality was achieved by reducing emissions instead of merely offsetting them. In this case, however, the customers did not receive this information immediately, but only when they asked for it on the telephone. This was not sufficient, because the information would have been necessary when the business decision was made.",

      "summary": "In December 2021, an anonymous party filed a suit against an anonymous corporation for misleading advertisement. \r\n\r\nThe defendant, a company selling sweets, advertised that it produced all products in a climate neutral way. The relevant advertisement contained the statement: ‘Since 2021, […] has been producing all products in a climate neutral way.’ It was undisputed between the parties that the manufacturing process of the products was not CO2-neutral, but that the defendant supported climate protection projects. \r\n\r\nThe plaintiff argued that the statement was misleading as it would be understood by the target consumer as meaning that the manufacturing process itself was climate neutral. At the very least, the advertising statement had to be supplemented to the effect that climate neutrality was achieved through compensatory measures. The defendant, on the other hand, argued that the complaint was unfounded, as it had taken several measures to reduce its emissions. It argued that because sweets could not be produced without emitting any CO2, the company supported climate protection projects, and thus, the CO2 released was offset in the balance sheet. The defendant further argued that the target public understood climate neutrality as balance-sheet climate-neutrality.\r\n\r\nIn June 2022, the Court found the advertising not to be a misleading commercial practice pursuant to the Act against Unfair Competition. The target audience of the advertising was a professional audience, because the advertising appeared in a food newspaper which addressed decision-makers in trade and the consumer good industry as well as industry-relevant service providers. The Court stressed that ‘climate neutral’ was not synonymous with ‘emission-free’ and that the former could also be reached through compensation. The targeted professional audience knew that climate neutrality could be reached through compensation. Therefore, the URL contained in the advertising under which information on the compensation could be find, sufficed. In contrast to consumers, it is common and reasonable for professionals to obtain information about a production from the information available on the internet.\r\n\r\nThe Regional Court's decision was appealed.",

      "summary": "Both parties distributed cleaning products to professional customers nationwide. The defendant had been certified by an external company as a ‘climate neutral company’. The defendant used this certificate in their advertising, such as ‘climate neutral company’ and ‘climate neutral hygiene’. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, the defendant had created and used a Youtube advertising video with such advertising claims. This video contained a URL with the website of the defendant with an explanation. The explanation contained comments about avoiding and compensating their emissions, using the ISO 14067 standard. It also included another URL where more information could be found. \r\n\r\nNext to the video, the defendant had also included an advertising on ‘climate neutrality’ on their website. The website included another URL where initial information on the topic could be found. The plaintiff argued that these advertisings were misleading. \r\n\r\nThe Regional Court of Frankfurt am Main found the advertising claims in the video to be misleading by omission and in breach of §5a para. 1 as neither the video nor the referenced website included necessary background information. The Court elaborated that the claim ‘climate-neutrality’ required a great deal of explanation. Without the appropriate background information, the claim of climate-neutrality remained opaque for the target market, whether consumers or professional buyers. The Regional Court stressed the importance of the manner that climate-neutrality was achieved, as only in this context could buyers assess how high the company’s efforts were to reduce or compensate their CO2 emissions. Ultimately, the claim ‘climate neutrality’ depended on the standard applied. According to these standards, it was only possible for buyers to assess whether a company was really concerned with its own reduction of CO2 emissions or whether it was merely ‘greenwashing’ if the company communicated the essential circumstances of climate-neutrality in clear and comprehensible manner.\r\n\r\nThe Court set out the specific disclosure requirements:\r\n\r\nAssessment basis (Reference object: company or product);\r\nStandard of calculation;\r\nExcluded emissions;\r\nScope of own CO2 reduction measures and their savings effect, in particular in relation to CO2 emissions prior to implementation of the reduction measures;\r\nType of compensation;\r\nType and subject of the supported and / or self-implemented climate project and its CO2 reduction effects.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the Regional Court found the advertising on ‘CLIMATE NEUTRAL COMPANY certified by Fokus’ on the website of the defendant to be a misleading commercial practice and in breach of § 5 para. 1 of the German Act against Unfair Competition. This claim was misleading because it had been advertised without further information and because it was unclear on which basis the certification of climate neutrality had occurred. Even though another website had been referred to in the advertisement, necessary information was lacking there too. A further reference on that website did not suffice as nested information remained unclear. Instead, the Regional Court held that the information should be presented in a compact manner on a single website, using transparent and clear language. ",

This case concerned an advertising on jams which included the statements ‘climate neutral product’ and ‘climate neutral value-for-money-classic’. While it was undisputed between the parties that the production process of the jams itself was not CO2 neutral, but that the defendant financially supported reforestation projects in South America, the plaintiff nevertheless considered the advertising statement as misleading. They argued that the target consumer group would understand the statement insofar as the production process itself was climate neutral and that the same applied to the readership of the newspaper where the advertisement was published. \r\n\r\nIn February 2022, the Regional Court of Mönchengladbach held that an average end consumer would not understand the defendant’s claims to mean that the CO2 produced during the manufacturing process was offset by subsequent measures and that climate neutrality was achieved in balance. While it could be assumed that a normally informed consumer knew of the concept of climate neutrality through compensation, the average consumer would relate the statement to the specific product and the manufacturing process and not to offsetting. This was especially the case because in the situation of selling jam jars, the focus was on quick messages and quick decisions. The same applied to the advertising in the newspaper.

The advertised claims at issue concerned distributed meat products as well as the defendant’s operations which were advertised as climate neutral in an online newspaper. The Regional Court of Oldenburg held that the advertising on climate neutral meat products and climate neutral operations were misleading by omission pursuant to §5a para. 2 of the Act against Unfair Competition.\r\n\r\nOn December 2021, Regional Court reiterated the strict standard applicable to environment-related advertising claims and concluded that the advertising did not fulfil these requirements. According to the Regional Court, the consumers understood ‘climate neutral’ in relation to the meat products either in the sense that CO2 emissions during the production or distribution were offset through climate projects or that CO2 had not been emitted (for instance, by using renewable energies or CO2 filters), or had been emitted in an insignificant manner. Thus, the Regional Court stated that there did not exist a clear consumer understanding of the statement ‘climate neutral’. \r\n\r\nThe Regional Court further held that the advertising would have needed to include a clarifying statement that ‘climate neutrality’ was understood in the sense of compensation and that climate neutrality was achieved through financial support of climate protection projects. While the defendant had listed a URL on the advertising site where the reader could learn more about the manner of achieving climate-neutrality, the claim ‘climate neutral’ had been made in the advertising without any mention of compensation, and thus, the consumer had not been able to make an informed business decision.

      "summary": "The plaintiff contests the distribution of bin liners in a package with a label ‘climate neutral’ as well as the indication that the product supports Gold Standard certified climate protection projects in order to achieve the UN climate goals. \r\n\r\nOn July 2021, the Regional Court of Kiel found the advertising claim to be misleading pursuant to §§ 5 para. 1 and §5a para. 2 of the Act against Unfair Competition. It stated that the average consumer understood the claim ‘climate neutral’ in relation to all of the defendant’s products. But because the defendant produced non-climate neutral products as well, this was inaccurate. Furthermore, the Regional Court stressed that climate neutrality could be achieved through various means. In order for the consumer to make an informed decision, it was essential that they received information on the manner through which climate neutrally was achieved in an unproblematic way. \r\n\r\nThe Regional Court did not find the indication on the support of Gold Standard certified climate protection projects as sufficient in this regard. The Regional Court found the indication of a website or a QR code on the packaging which included the relevant information to be necessary. This was not the case, as the information on the climate protection projects could only be found on further sub-websites. The Regional Court thus found that this did not meet the disclosure requirements, and moreover, that it suggested that the whole company was climate neutral even though this was not the case.\r\n\r\nHowever, on June 2022, the Higher Regional Court of Schleswig overturned this judgment. It did not find the design of the packaging to be misleading pursuant to § 5 para. 1 of the Act against Unfair Competition. Furthermore, it did not find the missing information on the packaging as to how climate neutrality was achieved as misleading by omission pursuant to § 5a of the Act against Unfair Competition, because it held that the means of achieving climate-neutrality was not essential information.\r\n\r\nMore specifically, the Higher Regional Court held that the claim ‘climate neutral ‘did not suggest that the company exclusively produced climate neutral products. Furthermore, it stated that ‘climate neutrality’ was an unambiguous statement and that it meant that the products advertised with it had a balanced carbon footprint. Lastly, it held that the claim ‘climate neutral’ did not mean that the balanced balance was achieved completely by avoiding emissions during the production. This applied all the more if the claim was combined with a clearly visible indication that climate protection projects were supported in order to achieve climate neutrality. It stated that explanatory notes on the type and scope of the compensation measures were not required. Thus, it did not find that the advertising claim ‘climate neutral’ for a product was misleading per se. This was all the truer if at the same time it was pointed out that climate neutrality was achieved through compensation measures. ",

      "summary": "In December 2022, the plaintiff filed a claim with the Regional Court of Stuttgart and argued that the advertising statements were misleading after the defendant themselves had massively relativised in other places. The defendant responded that the value was an investment ‘target’ and could therefore be exceeded as well as fallen short of. With regard to the various quantities, an amount that was too low had been stated by mistake. An imputed misleading was therefore not relevant in any case.\r\n\r\nCommerz Real Fund Management S.à.r.l. advertised a financial product, ‘klimaVest’, on a website. This fund invested in renewable energies projects and could therefore track concrete amounts of green electricity and avoided CO2 emissions. Furthermore, klimaVest was an Impact Fonds according to European Regulations and was obliged to pursue a positive ecological goal. This resulted in the ‘klimaVest target (set value)’ of at least 3.5 tonnes of CO2 avoidance per EUR 10,100 invested per year. Thus, investors were able to indirectly support the avoidance of future emissions with their investment. On the website, internet users could calculate their personal CO2 footprint. This value was then compared with the desired ‘CO2 offset’ through the investment. In a separate document, information was included that the investment objectives of the fund could not be guaranteed and that they could vary considerably over time. Under the FAQ category it was set out that the impact goal of klimaVest was to achieve a CO2 offset of at least 3.0 tonnes per year for every 10,000 euros of invested capital. The calculation basis for that was the CO2 calculator.\r\n\r\nOn January 2022, the Regional Court found the advertised claims to be misleading commercial practices and in violation of § 5 para. 1 of the Act against Unfair Competition. It held that the claim of an absolute CO2 reduction of 3.5t or of a CO2 compensation of -3.5t was a statement suitable to mislead the target public, since they understood these statements as set values, which in any case would not be fallen short of, although these were in fact target values which could be significantly undercut. Furthermore, the Court found the differing statements on the targeted CO2 avoidance of 3.5t on one site and 3.5t on another site to be misleading by omission pursuant to §5a para. 2 of the Act against Unfair Competition.",

The defendant argued that, in any case, they were taking measures to compensate the CO2 emissions by planting trees. \r\n\r\nOn August 2011, the Higher Regional Court of Koblenz upheld the Regional Court’s ruling.

After the Offshore Petroleum Regulatory for Environment and Decommissioning (OPRED), the UK’s oil and gas regulatory agency, reviewed Jackdaw’s environmental statement and found that it would not have a significant impact on the environment, NTSA approved the project. Greenpeace claims that OPRED did not factor the CO2 emissions that would be produced by burning the gas extracted from Jackdaw in its impact assessment of the project, and therefore its approval should be revoked.

      "summary": "On November 25, 2022, a group of over 600 young people born between 1996 and 2015 filed a class action lawsuit against the Swedish state, arguing that Sweden’s action on mitigating climate change is inadequate and thus in violation of their rights under the European Convention of Human Rights (ECHR). The complaint was lodged after two letters were sent to the Swedish state, one in May 2022 (to which the sitting Minister for Climate and Environment replied) and one in November 2022 following a change in government in October 2022 (to which there was no reply), where the plaintiffs outlined their requests. Specifically, the plaintiffs argue that the risk of the negative impacts of climate change constitutes interferences with their rights to life, private and family life, and non-discrimination under articles 2, 8, and 14 of the ECHR, respectively, as well as the right to property under article 1, protocol 1 of the ECHR. These interferences are argued to constitute rights violations since Sweden is failing to do its fair share to reduce the greenhouse gas (GHG) concentration in the atmosphere to keep warming below 1.5°C as compared to pre-industrial levels, by not undertaking immediate and adequate procedural and substantive measures to continuously reduce GHG emissions and enhance GHG sinks, thus failing to adequately protect the plaintiffs from adverse impacts of anthropogenic climate change. In particular, the plaintiffs argue that climate change impacts in the period leading up to 2100 will be serious, especially in relation to impacts on human health, and that they are expected to be particularly affected by these impacts because expect to be alive at that time, based on the average life span in Sweden. In terms of specific impacts, the plaintiffs cite longer and more intense heatwaves causing both mild and severe health effects, shorter and more temperate winters leading to the increased spread of diseases through ticks, and changes to precipitation patterns leading to health impacts stemming from flooding, among others. \r\n\r\nThe plaintiffs question both procedural and substantive aspects of Sweden’s mitigation policy. With respect to the former, the plaintiffs argue that the state has failed to adopt sufficient and adequate procedural measures by not investigating, in line with the best available science: (i) the extent of Sweden’s fair share to reduce emissions continuously, (ii) how the fair share is to be achieved in a manner that is economically and technically feasible, and (iii) how Sweden can contribute to reduce consumption-based GHG emissions abroad, GHG emissions caused by Swedish legal persons abroad, and GHG emissions from LULUCF, as well as protecting and restoring natural carbon sinks like forests, wetlands, and oceans. The emissions in question for points (i) and (ii) are those from industrial processes, product use, fossil fuel-based energy, agriculture, and waste (IPEJA emissions).\r\n\r\nAs regards their substantive claims, the plaintiffs argue that the state has failed to take sufficient and adequate measures to: (i) continuously implement Sweden’s fair share, based on the investigations mentioned above, (ii) reduce IPEJA emissions between 2019 and 2030 by at least 9.4 or 6.5 million tons CO2-eq annually, primarily national emissions insofar as possible, and to ensure safe atmospheric GHG concentrations after 2030 under any circumstances, (iii) reduce national IPEJA emissions between 2019 and 2030 by at least 3.1 or 2.2 million tons CO2-eq annually and to ensure safe atmospheric GHG concentrations after 2030 under any circumstances, (iv) secure that GHG emissions reductions within one category is not achieved through increasing emissions in another category under any circumstances, and (v) continuously compensate annual emissions that exceed the permissible emissions, by reducing the net emissions by an equivalent amount in the following period under any circumstances, starting in 2019.\r\n\r\nUltimately, based on these arguments, the plaintiffs ask the court to order the state to implement its fair share of GHG emissions reductions to keep global warming below 1.5°C, by adopting sufficient and adequate procedural and substantive measures to ensure that emissions are continuously reduced and that GHG are absorbed through natural carbon sinks, in order to limit the risk of negative impacts of climate change on them. The procedural and substantive measures requested mirror the complaints listed above.\r\n\r\nOn February 19, 2025, the Swedish Supreme Court rejected Aurora.

The law provides that coal-fired power stations may no longer use coal as a fuel to generate electricity in the long term (by 2030 at the latest). The law aims to reduce CO₂ emissions from power plants. \r\n\r\nThe case was brought by German energy companies owning three major coal-fired power plants in the Netherlands, stating that the law infringes on their property rights because it was  introduced without offering a financial compensation scheme. The energy companies had filed claims of EUR 1.4 billion and EUR 1 billion respectively against the Dutch state, claiming the ban on coal-fired power generation by 2030 was a form of expropriation in violation of their right to property in Article 1 of Protocol 1 of the European Convention on Human Rights, and the right to property in Article 17 of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. According to European human rights law, these provisions protect the right to property of both natural and legal persons.\r\n\r\nThe District Court ruled that whilst the law indeed infringes the right to property of the energy companies, this infringement is not unlawful. In light of the established case-law of the European Court of Human Rights, the District Court determines whether the Prohibition of Coal in Electricity Act follows the criteria for a lawful interference with the right to property. These criteria include the so-called ‘fair balance’ test, encompassing consideration of the nature and scale of the interference –  including whether the measure entails a ‘de facto expropriation’ which would normally be eligible for compensation – and its proportionality, necessity. and foreseeability.  In terms of expropriation, the Court applied a strict test following from ECHR case-law and a previous Dutch Supreme Court ruling. Notably: de facto expropriation does not exist in situations where, even ‘if a measure leads to the termination of the company, the entitled party retains any economic interest or a meaningful possibility to use (assets of) the company’. The Court decided that there are evidently several financial interests in continued use of the power plants, including as they may be reconverted to using other fuels, such as biomass. The measure did not amount to expropriation, instead, it fell with the sphere of lawful regulation of companies, which does not necessitate compensation per se.\r\n\r\nThe District Court further decided that the measures taken by Dutch State to reduce CO₂ emissions are proportional and that the interests of the owners have been sufficiently taken into account when adopting the law. According to the Court, the ban on use of coal was also foreseeable for the owners, especially if GHG emissions from power stations had not been reduced very significantly before 2020, for example by switching to biomass or by capturing CO₂. Such measures were not undertaken by the companies at their MPP3 power station and the Eemshaven power station. On the other hand, the Amer power plant already runs almost entirely on biomass. The owner of the latter station could have foreseen that this power station would not be allowed to be revert back to coal once a subsidy for use of (woody) biomass terminates at the end of 2027.\r\n\r\nThe Court also attached importance to the fact that there had been significant  international and national societal debate on these issues, signaling that curbs on coal fired electricity were to be expected in the near future. Specifically, companies could not have expected new coal-fired electricity plants that were planned from 2009 onwards to operate without any limitations until 2040. In addition, the prohibition on use of coal would not take effect immediately after the entry into force of the law. Owners are given a transition period during which they can still realize revenues from coal-fired power and limit their damage. In addition, they can use this period to investigate other uses for the power plants, and invest in conversion to biomass. Overall, a ‘fair balance’ was struck between the property rights of these energy companies, as associated with their coal-fired electricity plants, and the general public interest. The Prohibition on Coal in Electricity Production Act, demanding that companies phase out coal use by 2030, does not place an ‘individual and excessive burden’ on the energy companies.",

      "summary": "In February and April 2021, RWE and Uniper commenced ICSID arbitration proceedings against the Kingdom of the Netherlands (see RWE v. Netherlands), alleging that its decision to phase out all coal-fired power plants by 2030 violates the Netherlands’ obligations under the Energy Charter Treaty (ECT). \r\n\r\nIn response, the Netherlands initiated inadmissibility proceedings before the Higher Regional Court of Cologne, Germany on 11 May 2021. The Netherlands argued that the arbitral proceedings of the two Germany-based companies against an EU Member State qualified as intra-EU investment arbitrations, which are incompatible with EU law. RWE and Uniper in turn argued that the German Court does not have competence to decide on the matter. \r\n\r\nOn September 1, 2022, the Court declared both ICSID arbitral claims inadmissible pursuant to section 1032 (2) of the German Code of Civil Procedure, which provides that: “Until the arbitral tribunal has been formed, a request may be filed with the court to have it determine the admissibility or inadmissibility of arbitral proceedings.” The Higher Regional Court found the arbitral clause of the ECT incompatible with EU law and thus invalid in intra-EU arbitrations. The Court relied on a number of judgements handed down by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU), including the landmark ruling in Slovak Republic v. Achmea. According to the CJEU, arbitration clauses in intra-EU investment treaties are incompatible with the principle of autonomy of the EU legal order. Disputes on EU law rest within the exclusive competence of the EU judiciary to ensure the autonomy of the legal order and consistent interpretation of Union law. \r\n\r\nThe Court’s decision can be appealed. However, in September 2022, the German government’s announced that it would take over 99% of Uniper in exchange for which the company agreed to withdraw its ICSID claim against the Netherlands. Uniper’s ICSID proceedings are currently paused until January 2023.",

      "summary": "Volkswagen AG, a German company, used a technology on some of its cars to control and reduce nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions. The software operating the exhaust gas recirculation (‘EGR’) system was programmed in such a way that, under normal conditions of use, the EGR rate was reduced. In its European Comission (EC) type-approval procedure, the Kraftfahrt-Bundesamt (the German Federal Motor Transport Authority, the “KBA”) found that the software constituted a defeat device prohibited by Regulation No 715/2007. Volkswagen updated the software by setting the EGR valve so exhaust gas purification was fully effective only when the outside temperature was greater than 15 °C. The KBA approved that temperature window in its decision of June 20, 2016. \r\n\r\nDeutsche Umwelthilfe started a legal proceeding against Germany challenging the software’s authorization before the Administrative Court in Schleswig-Holstein, contending that the approved temperature window constituted a defeat device prohibited by the law of the European Union (EU law). The administrative court decided that Deutsche Umwelthilfe lacked standing to bring the challenge under German law. The court asked the Court of Justice of the EU (ECJ) in a preliminary reference whether the environmental organization might have standing based directly on EU law, in particular the Aarhus Convention on access to information, public participation in decision-making, and access to justice in environmental matters, read in conjunction with the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. The administrative court also ruled that the temperature window constitutes a defeat device but asked the ECJ whether the window can be justified under the exception in Regulation No 715/2007 that “the need for the device is justified in terms of protecting the engine against damage or accident and for safe operation of the vehicle.” \r\n\r\nOn November 8, 2022, the ECJ answered that an administrative decision relating to EC type-approval, which may be contrary to EU law, falls within the material scope of Article 9(3) of the Aarhus Convention, since it constitutes an act of a public authority that is alleged to contravene the national environmental provisions. An environmental association has standing under Article 9(3) of the Aarhus Convention if it meets the conditions under national law to bring legal proceedings. The ECJ also notes that member states must comply with the right to an effective remedy, enshrined in Article 47 of the Charter, when establishing the applicable procedural rules. Member states cannot impose criteria so strict that it would be impossible for environmental associations to challenge the acts or omissions that are the subject of the Aarhus Convention. The ECJ concluded that Article 9(3) of the Aarhus Convention, read in conjunction with Article 47 of the Charter, precludes a situation where such an association is unable to challenge a decision granting or amending EC type-approval which may be contrary to EU law. A defeat device can be justified by a need to protect the engine against damage or accident and for the safe operation of the vehicle. The ECJ held that such a justification only exists if the device strictly meets the need to avoid immediate risks of damage or accident to the engine of such a serious nature as to give rise to a specific hazard when a vehicle fitted with that device is driven. The need for such a defeat device exists only if no other technical solution makes it possible to avoid the above mentioned risks. The opposite conclusion could result in the exception being applied more frequently than the prohibition and would result in a disproportionate infringement of the principle of limiting nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions.

      "summary": "The applicants, as sixteen environmental NGOs, before filing the case at hand, made an application before the Presidency of the Republic of Turkey, requesting the annulment of the licenses of thirty-seven active coal thermal power plants in Turkey. The basis for this application is the scientific reports stating that the pandemics such as the recent coronavirus pandemic is a result of global climate change. Accordingly, it is alleged that the coal mines and thermal power plants play a leading role for climate change and therefore, their activities must be terminated. The Presidency of the Republic of Türkiye didn’t respond to this application in sixty days, which is deemed as a tacit rejection under Administrative Judicial Procedure Act. The applicants filed the case at hand in December 2020 and requested the annulment of the tacit rejection of the Presidency. \r\n\r\nPresidency of Republic of Türkiye stated in its defense, the authority to annul the license for the power plants belongs to the Ministry of Environment, Urbanization and Climate Change and Energy Market Regulatory Authority. Energy Market Regulatory Authority, in its defense, referred that the relevant authority for environmental assessments is the Ministry of Environment, Urbanization and Climate Change. Finally, the Ministry alleged that there is no scientific proof on the relationship between climate change, pandemics and coal power plants. \r\n\r\nThe Court rejected the case depending on (1) that the allegations made by the claimants does not constitute a legal ground for the annulment of the license of the power plant and (2) the claimants haven’t initiated any legal procedures against the production license, environmental assessment report and the documents on environmental permitting and license. In its decision dated 28 March 2022, The Court also stated that the license which has been granted in accordance with the legal regulations cannot be annulled upon abstract grounds and therefore the tacit rejection by the Presidency cannot be deemed illegal. \r\n\r\nThe case has been brought before the Regional Administrative Courts by the Claimants for appeal and on February 2023, this appeal has been rejected on the ground that the decision given by 11th Administrative Court of Ankara is found to be lawful.

      "type": "case",
      "count": 1,
      "summary": "Finland's Climate Act (423/2022) was amended to include new provisions on the climate plans of municipalities and on appeals concerning decisions made under the Climate Act. According to section 16 of the Finnish Climate Act, “[t]he Government shall monitor the implementation of the climate policy plans […] adequately to determine whether the targets concerning climate change mitigation and adaptation set out in the plans and the objectives referred to […] will be achieved. On the basis of the monitoring, the Government shall, if necessary, decide on the additional measures required to achieve the targets.“ The new Climate Change Act sets a target of reaching carbon neutrality by 2035 – a target recommended by Finland’s Climate Council. With the new law, there is now a legal obligation to reach carbon neutrality by 2035. However, the collapse of Finland’s carbon sinks in 2021 has created a situation where the government’s climate policy plans are insufficient for meeting the Climate Act’s targets. The reason is due to the intensive forest logging and the slowing down of forest growth that has become a source of greenhouse emissions.\r\n\r\nThe Finnish Association for Nature Conservation (FANC) and Greenpeace filed an appeal at the Supreme Administrative Court in Finland alleging a breach of the Finnish Climate Act, essentially claiming that the Finnish Government has neglected its duty to properly assess and decide on the need for additional measures pertaining to climate change mitigation when it decided to provide the Finnish Parliament with the Annual Climate Report. The environmental groups argued that the government had ignored its own laws by failing to protect the Nordic nation's carbon sinks which have fallen below the climate plans and to comply with the Climate Act, hence, the environmental groups demanded that the Finnish Government’s decision with respect to the Annual Climate Report 2022 be revoked and sent back to preparation. \r\nThe environmental organizations specifically refer to the obligations under the Paris Agreement, arguing that “Greenpeace and the Finnish Nature Conservation Union believe it is important to seek guidance from the court on whether the monitoring and updating of the progress of climate action works as it should according to the law and the parliament intention to act in the light of the statements. At the same time, it is the first time that more effective implementation of climate measures is demanded in Finland through legal channels.” \r\n\r\nIn the judgment on 7.6.2023, the Court found the case to be inadmissible on procedural grounds. The Court’s majority based its ruling on the well-established principle in Finnish administrative law that inaction does not constitute grounds for an administrative appeal, thereby finding the case inadmissible. The Court also emphasized:\r\n\r\n\"According to best available science, climate change is a question of humanity's fate, which threatens the living conditions of current and future generations on Earth, unless quick and effective measures are taken in terms of maintaining and increasing emission limits and carbon sinks. Therefore, postponing action shifts the responsibility into the future and makes it difficult to achieve the maximum 1.5 degree temperature goal enshrined in the Paris Agreement. The primary responsibility for fulfilling international [climate] obligations rests with democratically elected political decision makers. It is the court's job to ensure, on the basis of an appeal, that the decisions of political decision-makers are in accordance with the law and do not prevent the realization of human and fundamental rights.\"\r\n\r\nThe Court’s majority justified their decision with more detail than usual when dismissing a case on procedural grounds. The Court’s reasoning also includes a statement according to which:\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Administrative Court finds that (…) the legality of the Government's decision-making procedure in the manner intended by the appellant could be examined by a court of law in a case, in which failing to make the decision at this stage would lead to an end result in violation of the Climate Act, or the de facto actions of the Government would prove that it has no intention of making the appropriate decisions in order to achieve the targets and obligations required by the Act on a sufficiently rapid schedule. (Para. 69 of the Court’s Decision KHO:2023:62, emphasis added)\r\n\r\nThe Court dismissed the appeal after a 3-2 vote. A minority of two judges argued that the government had in fact taken a justiciable decision not to adopt additional climate policies. Their dissenting opinion emphasizes, inter alia, the strong link between climate change and human rights, as well as the need to provide access to legal remedies at the domestic level. ",

      "summary": "On December 12, 2022, the Co-Chairs of the Commission of Small Island States on Climate Change and International Law (the Commission), representing the Commission pursuant to Article 3(3) of the Agreement for the Establishment of the Commission, submitted a request for an advisory opinion from the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (the \"Tribunal\") on the legal questions set out below. The Commission referred the following legal questions to the Tribunal for an advisory opinion:\r\n\r\nWhat are the specific obligations of State Parties to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (the \"UNCLOS\"), including under Part XJI:\r\n(a) to prevent, reduce and control pollution of the marine environment in relation to the deleterious effects that result or are likely to result from climate change, including through ocean warming and sea level rise, and ocean acidification, which are caused by anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere?\r\n(b) to protect and preserve the marine environment in relation to climate change impacts, including ocean warming and sea level rise, and ocean acidification?\r\n\r\nStates concerned: Antigua & Barbuda, Vanuatu, Tuvalu, Nieu, St. Lucia, Palau. \r\n\r\nAs fixed by the order, the deadline to submit briefs was June 16th, 2023. By that date, 31 states and eight intergovernmental organizations submitted written statements pursuant to article 138 paragraph 3 and article 133 paragraph 3 of the Rules of the Tribunal. Ten additional groups submitted written statements not pursuant to these articles. Rwanda and the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations (FAO) submitted statements after the due date.\r\n\r\nOn May 21, 2024, the Tribunal issued a unanimous advisory opinion. Among other things, the Tribunal concluded that States Parties to UNCLOS must \"take all necessary measures to prevent, reduce, and control marine pollution from anthropogenic GHG emissions.”\r\n\r\nThe Tribunal held that anthropogenic GHG emissions into the atmosphere constitute “pollution of the marine environment” within the meaning of article 1, paragraph 1, subparagraph 4, of UNCLOS. In reaching this decision, the tribunal noted that the definition of “marine pollution” in UNCLOS contains three element: (1) there must be a substance or energy; (2) this substance or energy must be introduced by humans, directly or indirectly, into the marine environment; and (3) such introduction must result or be likely to result in deleterious effects (para. 161). The tribunal found that anthropogenic GHG emissions met each of these criteria because, “through the introduction of carbon dioxide and heat (energy) into the marine environment, anthropogenic GHG emissions cause downstream climate change and ocean acidification, which results in the deleterious effects illustrated in the definition of pollution of the marine environment.” (para. 178).\r\n\r\nWith regards to pollution control measures, the Tribunal found that under article 194, paragraph 1 of UNCLOS, “States Parties to the Convention have the specific obligations to take all necessary measures to prevent, reduce and control marine pollution from anthropogenic GHG emissions and to endeavour to harmonize their policies in this connection” (para. 243).  The obligation to take all necessary measures is a “due diligence” obligation, which requires States to put in place a national system to regulate polluting activities and to exercise vigilance to ensure the effectiveness of that system (para. 235). The Tribunal found that, in the context of GHG emissions, the due diligence standard “is stringent, given the high risks of serious and irreversible harm to the marine environment from such emissions” (para. 243). The due diligence standard may also vary in accordance with State capabilities and available resources, as States with greater capabilities and resources may be required to do more than States with lesser means. However, the Tribunal notes that even a State with fewer capabilities and resources must “do whatever it can in accordance with its capabilities and available resources to prevent, reduce and control marine pollution from anthropogenic GHG emissions” (para. 241).\r\n\r\nThe Tribunal also found that article 192 of UNCLOS “imposes a general obligation on States Parties to protect and preserve the marine environment” (para. 400). This obligation “applies to all maritime areas and can be invoked to combat any form of degradation of the marine environment, including climate change impacts, such as ocean warming and sea level rise, and ocean acidification” (para. 400).  The obligation “may include restoring marine habitats and ecosystems” where the marine environment has been degraded (emphasis added) (para. 386). Moreover, the obligation to take measures necessary to protect and preserve the marine environment mandates that States ensure non-State actors under their jurisdiction or control adhere to these measures (para 396). Similar to the obligation to prevent, reduce, and control pollution, the obligation involves a due diligence standard, with similar contours as described above. ",

Similar complaints for misleading advertising have been filed in the United Kingdom, Switzerland, Belgium, and the Netherlands to challenge the carbon neutrality claims of the Qatar World Cup. These complaints allege that FIFA has made a commitment to consumers and spectators to organize a carbon neutral tournament by reducing and offsetting GHG emissions. \r\n\r\nSpecifically, Notre Affaire à Tous claims that \r\n\r\n•\tThere is a lack of clarity of the statements advertised regarding environmental and climate performance of the 2022 World Cup in Qatar presented by FIFA. FIFA presents short and punchy messages, using superlatives on several occasions by calling the World Cup \"the most compact\" and \"the most carbon-neutral in history\". To be accurate, however, such messages must be supported in a way that is understandable and comprehensible for the public to which they are addressed (section 4 of the ARPP's Recommendation on sustainable development), especially in complex systems such as those presented here (section 9 of the Recommendation on sustainable development).\r\n\r\n•\tSuch statements are false as shown report by the NGO Carbon Market Watch, which found that the carbon neutrality claims made by the FIFA were based on a considerable underestimation of the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions generated by the organization of the World Cup.\r\n\r\n•\tOn its website, FIFA claims that the World Cup in Qatar will be \"the most compact in history\" or \"the most compact edition of the competition since 1930\". This claim is based on the reduced distance between the stadiums, which will \"significantly reduce carbon emissions caused by transportation, teams, officials and fans\", and result in \"the elimination of domestic flights during the competition.\" Notre Affaires à Tous claims that these allegations are false in light of the promotion of \"shuttle flights\" by several airlines in the Gulf region, which shuttled fans residing in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, or Muscat, Oman. \r\n\r\n•\tFIFA has chosen to \"green\" the carbon footprint of the 2022 World Cup by using \"carbon offsetting\" mechanisms that are not in line with international standards.

The plaintiffs maintain that the public management of the defendant, as the head of the Ministry, was incompatible with the probity and decorum required of leaders in office. Among other decisions and omissions considered undignified, they allege the violation of international commitments ratified by the Brazilian government to combat climate change, in particular the Paris Agreement. They claim that the ministerial policy implemented by the defendant has not been proactive in achieving Brazil's targets for reducing Greenhouse Gases (GHGs).

It states that deforestation causes irreparable damage to the Amazon Rainforest and affects the rights and way of life of the traditional extractivist community, which is based on the sustainable exploitation of natural resources. The action emphasizes that the Chico Mendes Extraction Reserve (RESEx) is an instrument of social justice and a vehicle for forest protection. It claims that the advance of deforestation has occurred due to the weakening of public policies, land invasion, road construction, density of access roads, and fires in the region, among other reasons. According to the plaintiff, beginning in 2019, there has been a drastic increase in deforestation. The RESEx Utilization Plan states that deforestation in areas with rubber plantations cannot exceed 10% of the area, and the action claims that this limit has been exceeded in approximately half of those areas. The IEA emphasizes that RESEx has a strategic role in providing environmental services to the inhabitants of the Acre River basin due to the supply of water. It also highlights the deforestation reduction targets for the Legal Amazon region in the Amazon Deforestation Prevention and Control Plan (PPCDAm) foreseen in Federal Law 12.187/2009 (National Policy on Climate Change (PNMC)), which, according to the IEA, are not being met. It points out that, as the Federal Union, IBAMA and ICMBio are not fulfilling their duty of management and control and are contributing to the damage to the RESEx and the community. It emphasizes the vital role of the forest in the carbon cycle and that approximately three million tons of carbon were released into the atmosphere due to illegal deforestation in the RESEx. The IEA argues that there is a need for full environmental reparation in addition to the obligation to restore the forest and argues that future studies should be done to calculate the compensation for associated damages, such as climate damage. It emphasizes the vulnerable situation of the community, which justifies the payment of compensation for collective moral damage. It also argues that there is a need to prepare a Forest Restoration and Deforestation Control Plan for the region. Finally, among the other claims, the author requests: (i) payment of compensation for the material damage caused to the environment in the amount of at least R$ 183,817,104.00; (ii) payment of compensation for collective moral damage in the minimum amount of R$ 100,000,000.00; and (iii) immediate forest restoration of the entire area deforested above the established limit, to be carried out according to a Forest Restoration and Deforestation Control Plan.

Specifically, Colombia and Chile requested the Court to refer to actions regarding regulation, monitoring, environmental impact assessment, contingency plans and mitigation of activities that can worsen the climate emergency. In this line, the applicants asked the IACtHR about the principles that should 'inspire' these actions, especially regarding adaptation, mitigation, and loss and damage. \r\n\r\nSecond, the requesting states focused on the state obligation to preserve the right to life against the climate emergency in the light of human rights and science standards. Here, the applicants requested an opinion regarding the scope of substantive and procedural obligations on human rights and the environment. The applicants especially asked the Court about the importance of protecting the right to access information to guarantee other human rights, such as the right to life, property, health and participation. \r\n\r\nThird, the applicants requested an opinion from the Court to clarify the differentiated obligations of the states to protect the rights of children and future generations from climate change. Here, Colombia and Chile mentioned articles 1, 4, 5, 11 and 19 of the American Convention and asked about the nature and scope of the right of children to access justice to present judicial actions for preventing potentially damaging effects of climate change. \r\n\r\nFourth, following the clarification of the scope of procedural obligations, Chile and Colombia asked the IACtHR to clarify the nature of the obligations of the states to provide judicial actions for adequate protection and reparation of the rights affected by the climate emergency. In the same sense, the applicants asked about the necessity to implement the obligation to consult for the climate consequences of certain activities.\r\n\r\nFifth, the applicants focused on environmental defenders' protection, referring to the American Convention and the Escazú Agreement. Here, the applicants focused on the obligations that states should comply with for protecting environmental defenders, especially indigenous people and women, for protecting ecosystems in the context of the climate emergency. \r\n\r\nFinally, Colombia and Chile focused on asking the IACtHR about the cooperation between states to confront climate change in the region, especially to clarify the shared and differentiated obligations amongst the region's nations. Here, the questions highlight the need for guidelines to clarify states' role in guaranteeing reparation measures by considering equity and climate justice principles. In addition, the applicants enquired about their actions to confront the migration triggered and exacerbated by climate effects in the region.   \r\n\r\nIn April and May of 2024, the court held three public hearings in Barbados, Brasilia, and Manaus. The hearings drew testimonies from scientists, affected communities, and civil society. \r\n\r\nOn July 3, 2025, the Inter-American Court published Advisory Opinion OC-32/25 on the human rights obligations of States in the context of the climate emergency. In the opinion, the Court affirms that States have obligations under the American Convention on Human Rights and the Protocol of San Salvador to prevent, mitigate, and remedy the human rights impacts of climate change. The Court explicitly recognizes that the right to a healthy environment includes the right to a stable climate and that exceeding 1.5°C of global warming would threaten the enjoyment of multiple human rights. It emphasizes that State obligations extend to both individual and collective dimensions, and may include responsibility for cross-border harm where a causal link is established. States must adopt effective mitigation and adaptation measures aligned with climate science, regulate private actors, and cooperate with other States, particularly under principles of equity and differentiated responsibility.\r\n\r\nThe opinion also underscores the need for procedural safeguards—including access to information, public participation, and access to justice—and highlights special protections owed to Indigenous Peoples, Afro-descendant communities, children, environmental defenders, and future generations. The Court draws on the Escazú Agreement, the Paris Agreement, and other international instruments as interpretive sources. ",

      "type": "case",
      "count": 1,
      "summary": "On July 6, 2020, the Federal Public Prosecutor’s Office (MPF) filed a Civil Action for Administrative Improbity, with a request for precautionary removal from office, against Ricardo Salles, at the time Minister of Environment of Brazil, claiming the practice of intentional acts that violated the constitutional duty to protect the environment. It states that the former Minister, through actions, omissions, practices, and speeches, promoted the dismantling of environmental policies, favoring unlawful interests in violation of the constitutional principles that guide the Public Administration. The MPF raises a vast set of acts by the former Minister that they allege have contributed to the intentional dismantling of environmental protection, based on four main aspects: (i) regulatory measures; (ii) transparency and participation measures; (iii) budget measures; and (iv) monitoring measures. As for normative dismantling, climate is highlighted regarding the extinction of the Secretariat of Climate Change and Forests. The MPF claiming that such an act would signal that the combating climate change is not a priority of the Federal Government and would distance Brazil from its international and national climate commitments. Regarding the budget dismantling, it questions the reduction of resources allocated to the Brazilian Institute for the Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (IBAMA) and the paralysis of the Amazon Fund due to the extinction of the operational and guiding bodies. The Amazon Fund is dedicated to financing REDD+ actions linked to the reduction of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions, and the MPF mentions its paralysis influences in lack of financing and implementation of the Plan for Prevention and Control of Deforestation in the Legal Amazon (PPCDAm), provided for in the National Policy on Climate Change – PNMC. The increase in deforestation and the Ministry's lack of action to combat it are associated with the failure to comply with climate commitments and deforestation reduction targets. Given a broad picture of dismantling of the protection of the environment, the MPF requested, as a preliminary injunction, the precautionary removal of Ricardo Salles from the post of Minister of the Environment, with a definitive request that the acts questioned be declared unlawful and as to sentence him to loss of public office.\r\n\r\nThe first instance judge denied the preliminary injunction request.  \r\n\r\nIn its reply, the Federal Government denied the existence of any wrongdoing by the former minister Ricardo Salles. It alleged the principle of separation of powers, affirming the inadmissibility of a lawsuit questioning the choice of the President regarding the appointment of public positions of trust. It emphasized that the acts questioned by the MPF are decisions of administrative merit, within the scope of the competencies of the public manager to direct public policies. Also, that they were carried out in accordance with the environmental agenda and in compliance with the laws and the Constitution.\r\n\r\nRicardo Salles presented his defense on October 3rd, 2023. He claimed there was no act of improbity, stating that the lawsuit was an attempt to force the judiciary to meddle in political choices. With regard to the environmental-climate issue, he alleged that there was no proof or evidence of any supposed predatory intent, or any evidence of Ricardo Salles’s private interests overlapping with public, diffuse or collective interests. The defense maintains that there has been no regulatory disruption, contrary to the initial allegations. It also argued that there had been no dismantling of transparency and participation bodies, since government policies can vary without this immediately meaning administrative impropriety. It also rejected the thesis of the alleged decrease in social representation in councils, with the edition of Decree No. 9,806/2019. Regarding the removal of information with maps of priority areas for biodiversity conservation from the internet, he claimed that the initial complaint was inept, emphasizing that this allegation is based solely on journalistic \"news\", which is not confirmed by mere access to the links attached to the case file. As for the alleged interference in the dissemination of data by INPE, it said it had no influence over the agency, since it is a research unit subordinate to the Ministry of Science, Technology and Information (MCTI). With regard to the undue restriction of institutional communication, it argued that the initial complaint was inept due to the lack of supporting evidence and insufficient description of the facts. It also argued that there had been no budgetary disruption, since it is not the responsibility of the Minister of State to draw up or discuss the Budget Law. He emphasized that there had been no dismissals of civil servants with a misuse of purpose, and he also denied that there was any risk to civil servants in their field activities or that the defendant's management had in any way affected this safety. Finally, he concluded by emphasizing that there was no act of improbity due to the absence of a material violation of the law and the absence of malice, requesting, preliminarily, the immediate dismissal of the action, in favor of the retroactivity of the more benign rule - with the new wording of Law 8.429/92, by Law 14.240/21. In the alternative, he argued that the action should be immediately dismissed due to the contestant's lack of competence to carry out the acts embodied in the decrees and the absence of a causal relationship with the alleged illicit acts, affirming the manifest absence of an act of administrative misconduct. If the previous theses are overcome, alleging that the initial complaint is inept due to the atypical nature of the facts set out in the initial complaint, as well as the lack of individualization and supporting evidence demonstrating the occurrence of the alleged conduct, he requested that the initial complaint be rejected. On the merits, he requested that the complaint be dismissed and that the Public Prosecutor's Office be condemned for bad faith litigation.",

Later, the Federal Public Prosecutor's Office (MPF), the Public Prosecutor's Office of the State of Santa Catarina (MPSC) and the Associação Nacional dos Atingidos por Barragens (ANAB) joined the plaintiffs. The environmental class-action was filed against the Municipality of Florianópolis; the Municipal Environment Foundation (FLORAM); the State of Santa Catarina; the Santa Catarina Environmental Institute (IMA/SC); the Santa Catarina Water and Sanitation Company (CASAN); and the Santa Catarina Public Services Regulation Agency (ARESC).\r\n\r\nThe lawsuit seeks the implementation of a socio-ecological governance system for the protection, control, monitoring and inspection of the ecological integrity of the Conceição Lagoon. The plaintiffs present the Conceição Lagoon as the subject of ecological rights and claim that, due to the organized irresponsibility of the current institutional structure, there is an unconstitutional state of affairs. They point out that there is, in its surroundings, a complex mosaic of dunes, sandbanks and forests, part of the Atlantic Forest biome. They explain the importance of the ecosystem services provided by the lagoon, especially for a greater capacity to adapt to climate change of the surrounding ecosystems and communities, which are more vulnerable to the effects of global temperature increase. The plaintiffs emphasize the role of the Lagoon for the local socio-cultural history, highlighting the importance of water quality for the identity of the communities in the region. They claim that the risks of perishing and collapse of the Lagoon's ecosystem are evident and urgent, generating violations of fundamental rights. They allege structural problems related to ineffective governance by the responsible actors. They claim that the impacts of human activities on ecological systems threaten diverse forms of life and are a matter of ecological justice. Finally, the plaintiffs request, among other things the recognition of the active legitimacy of the associations to claim, besides the protection of the collective right to the environment, the protection of the rights of the Conceição Lagoon. They seek a declaration of the Lagoon as a natural entity with specific rights. Also, they request the recognition of a structural problem which requires the institution of a Judicial Chamber for the Protection of the Conceição Lagoon (CJ-PLC); and, based on its findings, the establishment of a Judicial Plan for the Protection of Conceição Lagoon (PJ-PLC). \r\n\r\nA preliminary injunction was granted, determining the creation of the CJ-PLC, with the purpose of advising the Court in the adoption of structural measures necessary to guarantee the ecological integrity of the Lagoon as a natural entity. The Chamber is to be composed by the defendants and interested parties. In addition, the decision welcomed the inclusion of the Federal Public Prosecutors' Office (MPF) and the Public Prosecutors' Office of Santa Catarina (MPSC) as plaintiffs. The decision was appealed, and the Court of Appeal conclude that the CJ-PLC is not equivalent to a state agency; it does not have decision-making power or the power to impose obligations on any party to the proceedings. It clarifies that the CJ-PLC does not enjoy the prerogative of using public resources and is merely consultative nature to to advise the Court on issues that have already been litigated. After a conciliation hearing between the parties, an order was handed down in April 2022, approving the definitive proposal for the composition of the CJ-PLC and its Internal Regulations.",

The Auction results from the Federal Law 14.182/2022, which determined the privatization of Brazilian Energy Company Eletrobras, but whose legislative process included the insertion of unrelated content, determining the contracting of energy from gas-fired thermoelectric plants. The plaintiff alleges that the climate crisis is incompatible with the increase in greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) that will be generated by the thermoelectric plants, which could lead to a 39% increase in annual GHG emissions for the electricity sector compared to the levels registered in 2021. It points to several negative impacts associated with the projects of gas-fired thermoelectric plants to be installed in areas of the Legal Amazon. They will generate socio-environmental impacts on traditional communities, native peoples, and protected areas; compromise the use of local water resources, due to the high water-use; and increase the price of electricity for consumers. This would worsen climate change and violate the National Environmental Policy Act (Federal Law 6.938/1981), the National Climate Change Policy (Federal Law 12.187/2009), the Paris Agreement, and compromise the achievement of the Brazilian NDC. It is requested, as a preliminary injunction: (i) the suspension of ANEEL Auction or the suspension of its effects; (ii) in the event the Auction is maintained, it is requested that the defendants submit an inventory of GHG emissions from all the thermoelectric plants involved, as well as the impact of the emissions on compliance with the Brazilian NDC. In final, it is requested: (i) the cancellation of Auction nº 008/2022, with the annulment of all its effects and the determination that no new similar auction be held on the basis of Federal Law 14,182/2022; (ii) in the event the Auction is maintained, that the defendants be required, definitively, to submit an inventory of GHG emissions of all the thermoelectric plants involved, as well as the impact of the emissions on compliance with the Brazilian NDC.\r\n\r\nOn June 22, 2023, the court rejected the request for an injunction, considering that there was no urgency or danger of delay; on the contrary, it recognized that suspending the effects of ANEEL's auction would entail a danger of reverse damage. An interlocutory appeal was then filed against the decision, in which it was requested that the effects of ANEEL Auction 08/22 be suspended or, if the auction is maintained, that the defendants submit, within ninety days, an inventory of greenhouse gas emissions from all the fossil fuel-fired thermoelectric plants involved in the auction, as well as the impact of these emissions on compliance with the NDCs.

      "type": "case",
      "count": 1,
      "summary": "ClientEarth held shares in Shell Plc and was therefore a member of Shell. In that capacity it applied for permission to bring a derivative claim against Shell’s directors under section 260 of the Companies Act 2006. The claim concerned Shell’s climate change risk management strategy, as well as its response to the Milieudefensie v Royal Dutch Shell plc ruling. \r\nIn respect of these, ClientEarth alleged the directors had breached their general duties to promote the success of Shell (section172) and to exercise reasonable care, skill and diligence (section 174), along with certain specific or ‘incidental’ duties formulated by ClientEarth (such as a duty to make judgements regarding climate risk that are based upon a reasonable consensus of scientific opinion). The various alleged breaches of these duties were grouped by the court under the following headings: failure to set an appropriate emissions target; failure of the strategy to manage climate risk to establish a reasonable basis for achieving the net zero target and align with the 1.5oC; and failure to comply with the Milieudefensie ruling.\r\nThe court’s permission is required to continue a derivative claim of this nature. An application for permission cannot proceed if it appears to the court that it does not show a prima facie case for giving permission. On May 12, 2023, having reviewed the case papers, the High Court dismissed ClientEarth’s application on the basis no such prima facie case had been shown. ClientEarth exercised its right for that decision to be reconsidered at a hearing, following which the High Court re-affirmed its original decision, refusing permission and dismissing the claim. The court’s reasons are set out in its judgment of July 24, 2023. In summary:\r\nThere were a number of fundamental reasons why the breaches alleged did not establish a prima facie case. Firstly, very little weight could be given to ClientEarth’s witness evidence, which did not amount to expert evidence. Secondly, that evidence did not support a prima facie case that there is a universally accepted methodology as to the means by which Shell might be able to achieve its reductions targets. This meant it was very difficult to treat what was said as providing a proper evidential basis for alleging no reasonable board of directors could properly conclude that the pathway to achievement is the one they adopted. Thirdly, ClientEarth accepted the directors do have policies and targets to achieve net zero. Its case ignored the fact that the management of a business of the size and complexity of that of Shell will require the directors to take into account a range of competing considerations, the proper balancing of which is classic management decision with which the court is ill-equipped to interfere. (Judgment paragraphs 46 to 48.)\r\nAs to the Milieudefensie ruling, the Dutch court apparently accepted that Shell is not currently acting in an unlawful manner and recognised that it is a matter for Shell as to how it exercises its discretion to comply with reduction obligations imposed by Dutch law. There was no prima facie case that the directors had breached their duties in respect of the Dutch order. (Paragraphs 49 to 54.)\r\nAs to the relief sought, ClientEarth had failed to make out a prima facie case that the court should grant this. A mandatory injunction was sought that Shell (a) adopt and implement a strategy to manage climate risk in compliance with its statutory duties and (b) comply immediately with the Dutch Order. This was too imprecise to be suitable for enforcement. A declaration was also sought - that the directors had breached their duties in the manner described. Whilst this did not suffer from imprecision, it was difficult to see what legitimate purpose it would fulfil. It was not the court’s function to express views as to the directors’ conduct which have no substantive effect and which fulfil no legally relevant purpose. The proper forum for generating those types of view as to the directors’ conduct was by vote of the members in general meeting. (Paragraphs 55 to 59.)\r\nIt was appropriate also to have regard to certain discretionary factors in section 263 of the Act. These pointed towards there being no prima facie case for granting permission. (paragraphs 60 to 70.)\r\nIn a costs judgment of August 31, 2023 the High Court confirmed its refusal of ClientEarth’s application for permission to appeal to the Court of Appeal. In November 2023 the Court of Appeal refused ClientEarth permission to appeal, bringing the litigation to an end.",

      "count": 1,
      "summary": "As described in the lawsuit filed on February 4, 2022, the plaintiff entered into a contract with the defendant the Municipality of Monte Patria in May 2017 for services related to the Department of the Environment, where he maintained the city's gardens and public spaces, kept a record of the city plants, and trees, and shrub needs, and designed gardens for public spaces and schools. It was initially fixed until December 31, 2017 and then renewed every three months based on the evaluation of the person in charge of the Department. There were successive renewals of contracts until 31 December 2019. \r\n\r\nOn January 2, 2020, the Municipality amended his contract, assigning him the tasks of \"planning the recovery of public spaces, designing and executing projects for green areas under its Environment Director\". Upon November 30, 2021, the defendant notified him of the termination of his contract (\"non-renewal\"), and he was dismissed on December 31, 2021. According to the plaintiff, he was dismissed for political reasons and due to a discriminatory act by the defendant.\r\n\r\nAccording to the municipality, the complaint should be rejected. It states that since the employee is a public worker, the termination does not have to be justified since the contract's expiration suffices. It is claimed, however, that the termination of the contract was due to a restructuring of the Department of the Environment, as extreme drought requires actions that favour the sustainable use of water resources and address the drought in Monte Patria, which requires different planning than what has been done so far by the plaintiff.\r\n\r\nDue to the fixed-term nature of the contract, the Ovalle District Court rejected the claim, stating that the defendant municipality did not have to justify its termination. As for climate change, it maintains that the separation of the plaintiff was caused by an administrative reorganization affecting the unit or department where the plaintiff worked, such as Environment. The judgment indicates that the prolonged drought affecting the province and much of the country is public knowledge, so it seems reasonable to adopt measures to optimize water resources and reduce green areas of the commune, which happens to be the operational area of the plaintiff both in planning, monitoring and care; and this measure has justified the rationing of human resources for the plaintiff's responsibilities.\r\n\r\nThe plaintiff filed an action for annulment before the Court of Appeals for the City of La Serena. According to him, the dismissal was unjustified and politically motivated. Regarding the argument that the Department of the Environment should be restructured, he maintains that the climate crisis has been around the city for over 20 years, and that his work focuses specifically on water resource optimization, which demonstrates the weakness of the Municipality's argument.\r\n\r\nThe Court of Appeals of La Serena dismissed the appeal without addressing the defendant's climate change argument. A new legal recourse for unification of jurisprudence was filed by the plaintiff against this judgment before the Supreme Court. \r\n\r\nOn March 16, 2023, the Supreme Court dismissed the unification appeal as inadmissible without ruling on the merits of the case.",

The non-profit association \"Belgian Federation of Fuel Traders,\" four fuel oil suppliers, and a private individual who heats their home with a fuel oil boiler jointly sought the annulment of this Decree before the Belgian Constitutional Court (request no. 147/2022).\r\n\r\nThe complainants alleged that (i) the Region of Flanders exceeded the limits of its competences (in violation of the complex distribution of competences in Belgium as a federal State), (ii) that the Decree discriminates against fuel oil boilers and hinders free trade and freedom of enterprise, and (iii) that the Decree discriminates against fuel oil boiler owners depending on whether they live in a street where a natural gas network is available. The Constitutional Court rejected all three grounds for annulment in its Judgment of 10 November 2022.\r\n\r\nAs to the first ground for annulment, the Court noted that the measure at issue did not, as was argued by the complainants, have \"a market-exclusive effect\" and, therefore, did not fall within the (exclusive) competence of the Federal Government. \r\n\r\nWith regards to the second ground for annulment, the Court found that the difference of treatment created by the measure at issue pursued a legitimate objective of public interest, namely, environmental and climate protection. It referred to a preliminary scientific study conducted by the Flemish legislator, which showed that in 2019 fuel oil in the Flemish Region corresponded to a share of 35% in the greenhouse gas emissions from buildings and a share of 10% in greenhouse gas emissions not covered by the European emissions trading system. Furthermore, this scientific study showed that the phasing out of fuel oil boilers could make a significant contribution to Flemish emission reduction in the short and long term and that the emission factor for fuel oil is considerably higher than for natural gas, propane, and butane gas. Therefore, the Court considered that the legislator could decide that a mere incentive through premiums and awareness-raising would not suffice and opt to phase out only fuel oil boilers as a first step. \r\n\r\nFinally, the Court also rejected the third ground for annulment because the prohibition in principle on the installation and replacement of fuel oil boilers has positive effects on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and the protection of the soil, and the legislator has taken into account the impact of this ban on owners of existing installations by setting up a partial phase-out, focusing the ban on the most polluting heating installations, and giving owners of fuel oil boilers the possibility to switch to natural gas, thus offering them a viable alternative.\r\n\r\nAs a consequence, the request for annulment was rejected.",

      "summary": "In November 2022, the New Weather Institute (the Complainant) submitted a complaint against FIFA to the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA), the self-regulatory organisation of the advertising industry in the UK. The Complainant alleges that FIFA’s claims that the 2022 World Cup in Qatar was carbon-neutral are wrong and likely to mislead consumers in the UK, therefore breaching multiple provisions of the UK Code of Non-broadcast Advertising and Direct & Promotional Marketing (“the Code”), and specifically the provisions on misleading advertising and on environmental claims.\r\nFIFA presented the 2022 Qatar World Cup as “fully carbon-neutral” in its online presence. It operated a “climate pledge” mechanism targeting ticket holders, requesting of them to make efforts towards reducing their carbon footprint in their daily life, and informing those taking the pledge that their emissions were offset by FIFA.\r\nIn particular, the Complainant alleges that FIFA:\r\n-\tfirstly, ignored emissions reductions as an essential part of carbon-neutrality; it did not demonstrate that it has done everything it can to reduce its own emissions prior to compensating for the remaining emissions (e.g. when it decided to attribute the 2022 World Cup to Qatar, a country with little football infrastructure in place).\r\n-\tsecondly, used unsound methodology for its GHG accounting, breaching the Code by only partially accounting for the life cycle of the stadiums, by sending wrong signals regarding the stadiums’ impact on the environment, and by not taking into account day shuttle flights advertised for by Gulf regional airlines when calculating flight emissions of ticket holders.\r\n-\tthirdly, and more broadly, generally claimed that a mega-event like the World Cup can be compensated with offsetting. The carbon credits bought by FIFA fail to meet some of the carbon market standards, as they lack additionality and do not permanently remove carbon. Further, the Code was allegedly breached by FIFA by failing to reach the level of substantiation required for an absolute statement like that of carbon-neutrality.\r\nBy claiming carbon-neutrality in this way, FIFA allegedly gave ticket holders the impression that attending the World Cup does not have an impact on the environment.\r\nThe claim was joined with four other complaints into one joint proceeding before the Swiss Commission on Fairness. The commission upheld all five claims in June 2023. ",

      "summary": "In 2022, the Office of the Inspector General of Colombia and the Office of the Inspector in Environmental Matters filed a joint lawsuit before the Administrative Tribunal of Cundinamarca seeking the declaration of non-compliance by the Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development (the Ministry) and the President of their obligations under Law 1931 of 2018. The 2018 climate action law, as it is also known, establishes guidelines for climate action in Colombia. The statute’s main goals are to put forth climate change adaptation measures, mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, reduce the population’s and ecosystem’s vulnerabilities and promote a just transition towards decarbonization. \r\n\r\nPlaintiffs claim that it has been four (4) years since the climate action law was issued and the government (represented by the Ministry and the President) has failed to comply with articles 15, 18, 19, 26 and 29. Claimants argue that the initial term included in article 35 of the same law was of three (3) years since its sanctioning.\r\n\r\nArticle 15 orders the Colombian government to establish a regulatory framework to define and determine actions related to short, mid and long-term national determined contributions in the context of the UNFCCC. Article 18 commands the Ministry to issue guidelines regarding the creation, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of climate change comprehensive management plans at the regional level. Article 19 instructs the government to establish guidelines directed towards territorial entities and environmental authorities to incorporate climate change response and management in their environmental, land use and financing planning documents. Article 26 directs the Ministry to issue regulations regarding the National Information Service on Climate Change (created by the 2018 climate action law) and to outline the rules and procedures to articulate this to other existing systems. Article 29 enjoins the Ministry to establish a number of GHG annually negotiable quotas and delineate the transaction’s terms and conditions. \r\n\r\nThe Tribunal found that the obligation under article 18 had been fulfilled by the Colombian government through Resolution No. 0849 of 2022. This resolution establishes guidelines to create and implement climate change comprehensive management plans at the regional level in accordance with the 2018 climate action law. \r\n\r\nHowever, the Tribunal declared that defendants had failed to fully comply with the obligations encompassed in articles 15, 19, 26 and 29 of the 2018 climate action law. Despite some initial efforts to set forth climate action-related activities, the Tribunal found that the Colombian government has to date failed: (i) to regulate goals related to national determined contributions; (ii) to issue a legal document to guide territorial entities and authorities in incorporating climate change in their regulatory and planning instruments; (iii) to regulate the National Information Service on Climate Change (draft legislation is in process); and (iv) to establish GHG quotas (draft legislation is in process). As a result, the Tribunal ordered the Ministry and the President to fully comply with 2018 climate action law obligations and established a new term of six (6) months from the time the decision is final and enforceable. \r\n\r\nThe defendants filed an appeal before the Council of State. On April 27 of 2023, the Council of State upheld the Tribunal’s decision regarding the obligations of the Ministry of Environment to comply with Law 1931 of 2018. The Council of State also found that the office of the President lacked legal standing, so orders are directed only towards the Ministry of Environment, who has six (6) months to comply with the judgment.",

      "summary": "In October 2022, French environmental NGOs Notre Affaire à Tous, Les Amis de la Terre, and Oxfam France sent a notice of intent to sue BNP Paribas. Considering the answer by BNP Paribas, sent on January 24, 2023, as largely insufficient and unsatisfactory, the NGOs decided to bring suit before the Judicial Court of Paris. The notice of intent to sue - which was the first, and necessary, pre-trial step – and the subsequent summons filed before the Judicial Court of Paris on February 23, 2023 claim that BNP Paribas violated the loi sur le devoir de vigilance of 2017 (Law on the duty of vigilance, incorporated in articles L. 225-102-4 and L. 225-102-5 of the French Commercial Code), the articles of the Civil Code on the prejudice écologique (articles 1246-1252 of the French Civil Code), which refers to any “non-negligible impairment of the components or functions of ecosystems or the collective benefits derived by humans from the environment”, and BNP’s “unilateral commitment of will” to limit and combat climate change.\r\n\r\nThe law on the duty of vigilance provides that specific companies (those that employ “at least five thousand employees within the company and its direct and indirect subsidiaries, whose head office is located on French territory, or that has at least ten thousand employees in its service and in its direct or indirect subsidiaries, whose head office is located on French territory or abroad”) must establish a plan to prevent the violation of human rights and environmental damage that may occur in the course of their business. The plan must “include reasonable vigilance measures to identify risks and prevent serious violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms, the health and safety of individuals and the environment, resulting from the activities of the company and those of the companies it controls (...) as well as from the activities of subcontractors or suppliers with whom there is an established business relationship, when these activities are related to that relationship.” If the plan is not correctly drafted or is inadequate to measure and prevent these risks, the company is liable for the damages that it could have prevented. Anyone with a legitimate interest can also ask for injunctive relief to force the company to comply with the law, a groundbreaking preventative mechanism for French legal proceedings.\r\n\r\nThe summons sent by Notre Affaire à Tous et al. to BNP Paribas details multiple violations of the law. The violations relate not only to how BNP Paribas’ plan is drafted but also the lack of clarity concerning the report of information about investments and loans and, last but not least, the shortcomings of the measures that the bank allegedly implements to respect the parameters of the Paris Agreement. First, the plan is not self-sufficient, but it refers to other documents that do not provide for binding commitments. Second, it does not identify with sufficient clarity the climate risks deriving from its activities, both in terms of the fossil fuel projects in which BNP Paribas is directly involved and the companies that it supports through its financing and investments. Third, it is not transparent concerning the disclosure and reporting of information concerning BNP Paribas’ financing and investment activities, as it is limited only to some sectors and does not include scope 3 emissions. Fourth, the plan does not contain any precise and exhaustive information on the stocks and flows of financing and investments to companies active in the fossil fuel sector. Finally, the plan does not include the commitment to cease all financing and investments that support the expansion of fossil fuels that is necessary to comply with the law on the duty of vigilance. Therefore, the plaintiffs claim that BNP Paribas must immediately terminate any financing to companies which develop new fossil projects and any investment in any company which develops new fossil projects. Concerning its existing investments, BNP Paribas must exercise its voting rights and influence in order to force the invested company to renounce new fossil projects and adopt, detail and publicly implement measures compatible with limiting global warming to 1.5°C. If this is not possible, BNP Paribas must divest. Moreover, concerning its activities of financing and investment in any GHG emitting activities, it must adopt, publish and effectively implement all measures compatible with a 1.5°C trajectory. ",

      "type": "case",
      "count": 1,
      "summary": "In 2021, Students for Climate Solutions brought a case against the Minister of Energy and Resources. The plaintiff argued that the defendant Minister, in granting petroleum exploration permits under the Crown Minerals Act 1991 (CMA), had failed to adequately consider the effects of the exploration on climate change. Specifically, the plaintiff claimed that: (1) climate change was a mandatory relevant consideration for the purposes of New Zealand administrative law; (2) that the failure to consider climate change rendered the decision unreasonable; and (3) that the minister had failed to have proper regard for the Treaty of Waitangi, New Zealand’s founding document.\r\n\r\nThe Court rejected all three grounds of review. On the first ground, the Court found that the CMA was intended in part to promote the exploitation of natural resources, and that climate considerations were absent from the statutory scheme (which was instead designed to promote fossil fuel mining). Secondly, the Court found that the Minister’s decision was not unreasonable. And finally, the Court found that the decision did not violate principles of the Treaty of Waitangi. The Court accepted that the CMA should be interpreted, as far as possible, consistently with Treaty principles. However, in this case the Court found that the Minister sufficiently considered such principles, and they had been appropriately weighed against other factors – the Minister was not required to engage in any broader policy assessment. The Court also expressed concern that the relevant Māori authorities were not represented in the proceedings.\r\n\r\nThe Court also made general observations about the significance of climate change in the scrutiny of judicial review applied under New Zealand law. The Court both rejected a submission by the plaintiff that a more intense level of scrutiny was necessary, as well as a submission by the defendant that greater deference should be applied given the complex nature of climate change. \r\n\r\nSFCA appealed to New Zealand’s Court of Appeal. The Court unanimously rejected the challenge on May 7, 2024. The majority observed that climate change was not an explicit consideration listed under the factors the Minister was required to consider under s 29A of the Crown Minerals Act. It further rejected SFCA’s argument that climate change considerations were impliedly required by the Act’s purpose, relying instead on the Crown Minerals Act’s legislative history to determine that the Act was intended to: (1) support mineral exploration and mining for New Zealand’s economic benefit; and (2) allow for petroleum exploration in the Taranaki region in the interests of facilitating a “just transition”. The majority of the judges took no position as to whether a decision-maker under the Crown Minerals Act was permitted to consider climate change, as set out in s 5ZN of the Climate Change Response Act 2002. The Court specifically distinguished the Minister’s obligations from that of the decision-maker in Waratah Coal Pty Ltd v Youth Verdict Ltd (No 6), an Australian case, where the relevant statute expressly required the decision-maker to consider principles of “ecologically sustainable development”. However, Justice Mallon, in a concurring opinion, took the view that s 5ZN of the Climate Change Response Act does permit a decision-maker in this context to consider New Zealand’s overall 2050 emissions target, emissions budget, and relevant emissions reduction plans.\r\n\r\nOn the Treaty of Waitangi challenge, the Court of Appeal accepted that climate change might be relevant as a component of the Minister’s overall obligation toward Māori. However, it was sufficient that the Minister had considered localized impact on Māori iwi (tribes) in the neighboring area, rather than climate change’s long-term disproportionate impact on Māori as a whole. \r\n\r\nOn February 24, 2025, the Supreme Court granted leave to appeal the Court of Appeal's decision. Without limiting the scope of the appeal, the Court has directed counsel to address whether the climate change considerations set out in section 5ZN of the Climate Change Response Act 2002 are mandatory, permissive, or irrelevant considerations when granting a petroleum exploration permit.

      "summary": "On January 31, 2023, the NGO Declic and a group of individuals issued an application for judicial review  before the Cluj Court of Appeal against the Romanian Government, the Ministry of Energy, the Ministry of Environment, Water and Forests, seeking that the court order the authorities to take all necessary measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (hereinafter GHG) by 55% by 2030 compared to 1990 levels and to achieve climate neutrality by 2050. They also demand that the Court order the Romanian Government et al. to take adequate measures to increase the share of renewable energy in final energy consumption to 45% and to increase energy efficiency by 13% by 2030.\r\n\r\nLast but not least, they requested the court to order the Romanian authorities to implement concrete and coherent climate change mitigation and adaptation plans, including annual carbon budgets, within a maximum of 30 days from the final judgment, in order to meet the objectives of the Paris Agreement.\r\n\r\nIn a nutshell, there were three big questions needed to be answered by the Court:\r\n1. Whether national authorities are in breach of their legal obligations by applying GHG emission reduction targets for 2030 that are significantly lower than the target agreed at EU level for 2030.\r\n2. Whether, according to objective standards, the measures taken by central authorities are sufficient, proportionate and will result in limiting global warming to 1.5-2 degrees Celsius?\r\n3. Are the measures taken by the defendants compatible with the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Romanian Constitution, the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights and the ECHR (right to a future in accordance with human dignity, right to health and an ecologically balanced environment, right to life and privacy)?\r\n\r\nThe defendants objected that the co-plaintiffs lacked standing and sufficient interest to bring the case to the court.\r\nThey also argued that such an action, if granted, would violate the principle of the separation of powers.\r\nThe Ministry of Environment, Water and Forestry had also raised the objection of passive standing in respect of the 2nd head of the claim- to take adequate measures to increase the share of renewable energy in final energy consumption to 45% and to increase energy efficiency by 13% by 2030.\r\n\r\nThe legal reasoning of the Court of First Instance\r\nThe trial judge rejected the objection of lack of locus standi and the objection of the lack of interest on the part of the applicants, essentially by holding that the present case concerned an unjustified refusal to deal with an application which had implications in terms of the right to life and to a healthy environment, so that Article 1 of the Administrative Litigation Act No. 554/2004 ought to be applied. In determining the objections raised by the defendants, the Court duly took into account Article 95, Article 20 (6), Article 3, and Article 5 of GEO No. 195/2005- Law on Environmental Protection, in conjunction with Article 3 of Declic’s  Articles of Association.\r\nThe Court of First Instance dismissed the objection of passive standing in relation to the 2nd head of claim on the ground that a shared/interdependent power is established between the Ministry of the Environment, Water and Forestry and the Ministry of Energy with a view to ensuring an increase in the share of renewables in the final energy consumption and an increase in energy efficiency. Moreover, the trial judge noted that the question of the existence or non-existence of the rights and obligations asserted in relation to certain specific measures necessary to achieve the quotas set out in the application is a matter of substance, not of standing.\r\nAt the same time, the trial judge expressed neatly that in the case of a complex action which comprises several heads of claim which interfere with each other, the existence of the defendants' passive standing must be analysed in relation to the whole of the action, and not in relation to each head of claim, in a piecemeal manner, as such an analysis would be hollow and devoid of legal finality.\r\n\r\nHowever, when considering the merits of the case, the Court of First Instance dismissed the co-pliantiffs’ application, for the following key reasons:\r\n        Granting the application:  when the operative part of the judgment does not  because it cannot, identify what measures are necessary and  the concrete and coherent plans to achieve the climate objectives, would result in  the delivery of a judgment which is unenforceable and which would constitute a violation of Article 6 of the European Convention on Human Rights, with reference to the case law of the European Court of Human Rights, which has held that the right to apply to a court would be illusory if the domestic legal order of a Contracting State allowed a final and binding judgment to be ineffective to the detriment of a party (Imobiliara Saffi v Italy - 1999, paragraph 63; Dorneanu v Romania - 2007, paragraph 32).\r\n\r\n         By granting a judgment allowing the claimants' action, without indicating any criteria on the basis of which the claim contained in the enforceable title becomes certain (the claimants leaving the defendants free to decide on the measures to be taken, even though the premise of the present dispute is, from their point of view, precisely the inadequacy of the measures taken), the judgment debtors are left free to refuse or to determine the scope and application of the enforceable title themselves.\r\nThe plaintiffs appealed against the judgment. \r\nThey also submitted a memorandum to the Romanian Supreme Court, requesting it to ask the European Court of Human Rights for an advisory opinion under the 16th Protocol to the ECHR on the following points:\r\n(1)         Does the decision of the court of first instance dismissing the action for failure to identify a specific measure to which the defendants are to be obliged infringe the doctrine of the margin of appreciation enshrined in the case-law of the ECtHR?\r\n(2)         The question to be answered by the ECtHR is whether, having regard to the individual circumstances of the present case, the national court can be considered to have taken a decision on the merits of the case concerning the rights alleged to have been infringed, within the meaning of Article 13 ECHR and as consolidated in ECtHR case-law?\r\n(3)         Whether the refusal to hear the case on the ground that the collective effort to combat climate change entails the jurisdiction of a supranational jurisdiction violates the procedural rights under Articles 6 and 13 ECHR?\r\n(4)         Whether the removal of soft-law interpretation tools from the case, without giving reasons constitutes a violation of Articles 6 and 13 ECHR?\r\n(5)         Whether the violation of the rights of access to a court and to an effective remedy amounts to a violation of Articles 2 and 8 ECHR, as well as the constitutional right to a healthy and ecologically balanced environment?\r\n",

      "type": "case",
      "count": 1,
      "summary": "On February 21, 2023, a group of Austrian children filed a complaint with the Austrian Constitutional Court. The applicants alleged that the Federal Climate Protection Act (Klimaschutzgesetz 2011) is, in part, unconstitutional for violating the constitutionally guaranteed rights of children and the fundamental right to equality before the law. The Austrian Constitutional Court rejected the application as inadmissible by decision of 27 June 2023. According to the Court, the scope of the application was too narrow, and repealing the contested provisions would not have eliminated the underlying unconstitutionality. Relying on its earlier case law, the court, therefore, considered the application as inadmissible. Further, the court held that repealing the contested phrases would have given the contested provision of the Federal Climate Protection Act a different content. Repeal would thus amount to an act of legislation by the court, which is prohibited due to the separation of powers principle. \r\n\r\nBackground\r\nThe Federal Climate Protection Act was adopted in 2011 to implement emission reduction obligations under European law. The Annexes to the Act set out the maximum levels of greenhouse gas emissions by sector for 2008-2012 and 2013-2020. However, the Act does not stipulate any emissions reduction targets after 2020. The lack of binding greenhouse gas emission reduction targets leads to persistently high emission levels on Austrian territory. In light of this, the applicants alleged the unconstitutionality of Art 3 para 2 of the Federal Climate Protection Act for (a) establishing commitment periods that only extend to 2020, (b) stipulating a pure negotiation obligation regarding the development of effective GHG reduction targets (instead of a mandate to take action) and (c) providing retrospective (instead of preventive) emergency measures in case of an exceedance of GHG ceilings established under international or EU law. In concrete terms, the applicants brought forward that Art 3 para 2 of the Federal Climate Protection Act violated children’s rights and their right to equality before the law. In eventu, the applicants further demanded the repeal of parts of Art 3 para 1 of the Federal Climate Protection Act. \r\n\r\nRights of Children \r\nThe Federal Constitutional Act on the Rights of Children implements the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child on the national level; it grants subjective rights (“constitutionally guaranteed rights”) to children, i.e., persons under the age of 18 years. Under Art 1, every child has the right to have his or her best interests protected. This includes protection and care, the best possible development and the safeguarding of child interests; in addition, Art 1 requires consideration of intergenerational equity. This commitment to intergenerational equity can also be found in the Federal Constitutional Act on Sustainability, Animal Protection, Comprehensive Environmental Protection, Water and Food Security as well as Research. This state objective that does not grant subjective rights but shall guide the interpretation of other legal sources. \r\nThe plaintiffs alleged that climate change triggers positive obligations under Art 1 of the Federal Constitutional Act on the Rights of Children as it poses an imminent danger to the well-being of present and future generations. Thus, Austria is obligated to take adequate measures to protect child well-being against the disastrous impacts of climate change and restrictions of freedom related to drastic emission reduction measures needed in the future. Such need for drastic emission reduction is evident as – according to the plaintiffs – the scope of state obligations under Art 1 of the Federal Constitutional Act on the Rights of Children is to be interpreted through the latest scientific findings as well as EU and international legal requirements. These sources allow calculating of a national CO2 budget based on the internationally agreed 1.5°C target. Said CO2 budget, in turn, constitutes a “finite resource” in the sense of the Federal Constitutional Act on Sustainability. Thus, it is to be managed sustainably, and its consumption should respect the interests of future generations. \r\nIn a nutshell, the applicants argued that constitutional law requires (a) the non-exceedance of the national CO2 budget and (b) equitable distribution of the remaining budget between generations in order to prevent a violation of the plaintiffs’ constitutionally guaranteed rights to (child) well-being. The plaintiffs asserted that Art 3 para 2 of the Federal Climate Protection Act does not meet these requirements and therefore violates Art 1 of the Federal Constitutional Act on the Rights of Children, which is to be interpreted in light of the Federal Constitutional Act on Sustainability. \r\nThe applicants reached a similar conclusion based on the Charta of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (CFR). According to Art 51 CFR, the Charta’s scope is principally opened as adopting the Federal Climate Protection Act constitutes an implementation of GHG reduction targets determined under EU law. Art 24 CFR stipulates that children shall have the right to such protection and care as is necessary for their well-being. Under EU law, children thus have a right to protection of their well-being, similar to the national right. The European rights of the child under Art 24 CFR are to be interpreted in light of Art 37 CFR, which, in turn, refers to the principle of sustainable development. In a manner comparable to the Federal Constitutional Act on Sustainability, Art 37 CFR imposes an obligation to manage resources in an equitable and fundamental rights-respecting manner. This includes Austria’s remaining CO2 budget, which is to be distributed equitably between generations to protect the rights of the child under Art 24 CFR.\r\n\r\nRight to Equality before the Law \r\nThe application also relied on the right to equality before the law for asserting the unconstitutionality of Art 3 para 2 of the Federal Climate Protection Act. This fundamental right entails a principle of fair burden sharing; in particular, it prohibits the realisation of the welfare of all (or the majority) at the expense of the few. The applicants alleged that Art 3 para 2 of the Federal Climate Protection Act violated the right to equality before the law for two reasons. First, the provision infringes the general principle of objectivity (“allgemeines Sachlichkeitsgebot”), inherent to the right to equality before the law. Second, they alleged that Art 3 para 2 of the Federal Climate Protection Act entails unequal treatment of children compared to adults, which cannot be justified. \r\nThe general principle of objectivity requires that legal norms serve the public interest and seek to realise it with appropriate, necessary and proportionate means. If this is not the case, the legal norm is not objective and thus unconstitutional. According to the applicants, the Federal Climate Protection Act must thus meet two requirements: First, individual norms must be suitable (“appropriate”) to achieve the Act’s general objective, enabling the coordinated implementation of effective climate protection measures and ensure a rapid reduction of GHG emissions. Second, burdens associated with reducing GHG emissions must be distributed evenly between members of society. The Federal Climate Protection Act does not meet these requirements: Art 3 para 2 of the Act violates the principle of fair burden sharing as the lack of binding reduction pathways causes a rapid consumption of the remaining CO2 budget, which could be used up entirely already in 2025. Consequently, the GHG reduction burden is transferred to younger generations and not equitably distributed between all members of society. In addition, the applicants noted that it is impossible to achieve the Act’s objective (to comply with international and EU mitigation obligations) without legally binding GHG reduction pathway. Art 3 of the Federal Climate Protection Act hinders the adoption of a legally binding pathway in providing a pure negotiation obligation paired with references to past commitment periods only. Overall, Art 3 thus undermines the objective of the Federal Climate Protection Act.  \r\nThe applicants further alleged that Art 3 para 2 of the Federal Climate Protection Act provides for unequal treatment of children compared to adults. This is because the current formulation and design of the Federal Climate Protection Act (especially the lack of legally binding reduction pathways) allow for rapid consumption of the remaining CO2 budget (probably until 2025). Consequently, the burdens associated with emission reduction are largely transferred to the future and, thus, to younger generations. Younger generations are treated unequally compared to older generations as they bear the brunt of restrictions of freedom associated with emission reduction, especially as restrictions of freedom will be more severe the more time passes without action. According to the plaintiffs, such unequal treatment is not justified and thus violates their right to equality before the law.   ",

The UNGA resolution also takes note of the scientific consensus expressed, inter alia, in the reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. In particular, the UNGA underscores that anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases are “the dominant cause of the global warming observed since the mid-20th century” and that human-induced climate change “has caused widespread adverse impacts and related losses and damages to nature and people.”\r\n\r\nIn this context, the UNGA recalls the importance of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement “as expressions of the determination to address decisively the threat posed by climate change”. The resolution also underscores the importance of implementing these treaties, particularly in light of the significant gap between States’ current nationally determined contributions and the emission reductions required to hold the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C, as well as the gap between current levels of adaptation and the levels needed to respond to the adverse effects of climate change.\r\n\r\nTherefore, in accordance with Article 96 of the Charter of the United Nations, the UNGA requests the ICJ to render an advisory opinion on the following questions:\r\n\r\n“Having particular regard to the Charter of the United Nations, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the Paris Agreement, the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, the duty of due diligence, the rights recognized in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the principle of prevention of significant harm to the environment and the duty to protect and preserve the marine environment,\r\n\r\n(a) What are the obligations of States under international law to ensure the protection of the climate system and other parts of the environment from anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases for States and for present and future generations;\r\n\r\n(b) What are the legal consequences under these obligations for States where they, by their acts and omissions, have caused significant harm to the climate system and other parts of the environment, with respect to:\r\n\r\n(i) States, including, in particular, small island developing States, which due to their geographical circumstances and level of development, are injured or specially affected by or are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change?\r\n\r\n(ii) Peoples and individuals of the present and future generations affected by the adverse effects of climate change?”\r\n\r\nOn April 12, 2023, the request for an advisory opinion was transmitted to the Court by the Secretary-General of the United Nations. Presentations of written statements were due on March 22, 2024. The ICJ received 91 written statements. \r\n\r\nWritten comments were submitted on August 15, 2024. The ICJ received 62 written comments. The public hearings are scheduled for December 2, 2024. ",

      "type": "case",
      "count": 1,
      "summary": "This case first began in 2019 after the thermal power plant (TPP) Maritsa-Iztok 2 got its integrated permit for operation renewed indefinitely, allowing the plant to release mercury and sulphur oxides above set emissions limits. The Court of First Instance (Administrative Court Stara Zagora) dismissed the case, stating that there is no violation of the Aarhus Convention, even though the operations of the TPP in question have a transboundary effect. The Court also did not find any violations of the national Code of Administrative Procedure or the European Directives on ambient air quality and industrial emissions.\r\n\r\nThe Applicants appealed the judgment before the Administrative Court of Cassation (ACC). The ACC requested a preliminary ruling from the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU). The ACC found that there is discrepancy between the update of the plan for the management of ambient air quality in the municipality of Galabovo, developed for the pollutants: particulate matter (PM10) and sulphur dioxide (SO2) for 2019-2023 and the appealed decision of the Executive Director of the Environment Executive Agency. Namely, the reduced desulphurisation rates authorized by the Executive Director in the decision at issue are not consistent with the minimum desulphurisation rate of 98%. Furthermore, the authorized daily and hourly average rates of SO2 are systematically exceeded, which led, inter alia, to the adoption and update of the plan referred to above and gave rise to the bringing of an action for failure to fulfill obligations in Case C‑730/19, Commission v. Bulgaria. The ACC asked the CJEU three questions relating to the obligations of the competent authorities when considering a request for a derogation from the set emission limit values when reissuing integrated permits.\r\n\r\nOn March 9, 2023, the CJEU gave its judgment on the preliminary ruling. The CJEU found that a derogation from the set emission limit values may be granted only if less strict emission limit values do not cause 'significant pollution' and, in spite of that derogation, a 'high level of protection of the environment as a whole' could be achieved. Moreover, the pollution in excess of the air quality limit values for SO2 in the area of the TPP in question cannot be regarded as insignificant pollution, but could objectively be described as 'significant pollution'. Thus, a derogation from the set emission limit values could not be granted, if it is such as to contribute to exceeding air quality limit values set by Directive 2008/50 for SO2. Additionally, the competent authority empowered to grant such a derogation must also refrain from setting less strict emission limit values for pollutants originating from an installation where such a derogation would be contrary to the measures established in the air quality plan adopted in the zone concerned. \r\n\r\nThis judgment came in a moment when there was talk in Bulgaria of renegotiating the Recovery Plan, which originally envisioned a 40% reduction in thermal power plant emissions and the introduction of more energy from renewable sources. Even though the judgment considered sulfur emissions, its principles could be very well be applied to other pollutants that originate from thermal power plants like Maritsa-Iztok 2.\r\n\r\nAfter the CJEU judgment on the preliminary ruling, the case returned to the Bulgarian ACC, which must decide the case on its merits.\r\n\r\nOn July 31, 2023 the Administrative Court of Cassation (ACC) issued a judgment, revoking the first-instance judgment of the Administrative Court Stara Zagora, which  back in 2019 ruled that the renewal of the integrated permit for operation of the thermal power plant (TPP) Maritsa-Iztok 2, famous for releasing mercury and sulphur oxides above the norms. The ACC finds substantive violations of the rules of court procedure, committed by the Court of First Instance and thus sends back the case to be examined by another division of the Administrative Court Stara Zagora.\r\n\r\nIn March 2024, after the second examination of the case by the Administrative Court Stara Zagora, the Court issued a judgment revoking the decision for the renewal of the integrated permit for operation of the TPP. According to the Court, the limit values document must be reissued to comply with the requirements for mercury and sulphur dioxide. The judgment was appealed before the Supreme Administrative Court, which in October 2024 discontinued the case due to technical errors in the first instance judgment. The TPP, whose integrated permit is in dispute, has been receiving a large amount of state aid, without which it would not be able to continue operation due to sharp decline in profits in the past years and the spike in renewable energy in the country.",

      "summary": "On October 11, 2022, NGOs Comissão Pastoral da Terra and Notre Affaire à Tous sent a notice of intent to sue BNP Paribas in relation to its financing of businesses allegedly responsible for the deforestation of Amazon and violations of human rights. Considering the answer by BNP Paribas as largely insufficient and non-satisfactory, the NGOs have decided to bring suit before the Judicial Court of Paris.\r\n\r\nThe notice of intent to sue - which was the first, and necessary, pre-trial stage – and the following summons filed before the Judicial Court of Paris, claim BNP Paribas violated the loi sur le devoir de vigilance of 2017 (Law on the duty of vigilance; incorporated in articles L. 225-102-4 and 225-102-5 of the French Commercial Code).\r\n\r\nThe law on the duty of vigilance provides that specific companies (those who employ “at least five thousand employees within the company and its direct and indirect subsidiaries, whose head office is located on French territory, or that has at least ten thousand employees in its service and in its direct or indirect subsidiaries, whose head office is located on French territory or abroad”) must establish a plan to prevent the violation of human rights and environmental damage that may occur in the course of their business. The plan must “include reasonable vigilance measures to identify risks and prevent serious violations of human rights and fundamental freedoms, the health and safety of individuals and the environment, resulting from the activities of the company and those of the companies it controls (...) as well as from the activities of subcontractors or suppliers with whom there is an established business relationship, when these activities are related to that relationship.” If the plan is not correctly drafted or is inadequate to measure and prevent these risks, the company is liable for the damages that it might have prevented. Anyone with a legitimate interest can also ask for injunctive relief to force the company to comply with the law, a groundbreaking preventative mechanism for French legal proceedings.\r\n\r\nThe summons sent by Comissão Pastoral da Terra and Notre Affaire à Tous to BNP Paribas details multiple violations of the law, stating that the bank’s vigilance plan is not adequate to prevent the violations of human rights.\r\n\r\nIn particular, BNP Paribas provides financial services without adequate due diligence to corporations, such as Marfrig, one of the world’s largest producers of beef. Suppliers to Marfrig have allegedly engaged in severe deforestation of the Amazon, land-grabbing of protected indigenous territories, and forced labor in cattle farms. \r\n\r\nThe beef sector is the largest driver of deforestation in the Amazon, and it is also among the largest sources of methane emissions.\r\n\r\nThe violations relate not only to how BNP Paribas’ plan is drafted but also the lack of clarity concerning int environmental commitments and the fact that the plan identifies as a risk only deforestation, and not also the seizure of indigenous peoples’ land, forced labor, and methane emissions. Moreover, the plan does contain adequate measures to mitigate the abovementioned risks of human rights’ violations. \r\n\r\nTherefore, the plaintiffs claim that the Court has to order BNP Paribas to fulfill its obligation relating to the duty of vigilance and, therefore, to implement a new plan. \r\n\r\nIn this plan, BNP Paribas should: \r\n- group together all the elements relating to the law on the duty of vigilance within its plan;\r\n- put an end to the ambiguity of its environmental commitments within its vigilance plan and in its public communication, which contributes to greenwashing;\r\n- identify the risks of invasion of indigenous territories, slavery-like practices, and methane emissions, particularly from cattle farming and in Brazil, and adopt appropriate risk mitigation and prevention measures accordingly;\r\n- measures to assess the situation of suppliers and take appropriate risk mitigation and prevention actions to ensure that its customers’ supply chains do not contribute to deforestation, use slavery-like practices, or infringe on the rights of indigenous peoples;\r\n- establish an easily accessible alert and reporting mechanism for third parties who are or may be affected by negative impacts caused by the Group's activities and customers.\r\n- establish a specific system for monitoring the measures implemented and evaluating their effectiveness.",

      "summary": "In 2017, two wind energy developers Eurowind OÜ and Nelja Energia AS submitted an application to Sauga parish (now Tori parish) for the approval of design provisions for constructing a wind park. According to the area planning, the area under question is a peat deposit that is also suitable for wind park construction. At the time of the application, three companies held permits for extracting peat. Sauga parish denied approval of design provisions, because peat extraction was supposed to continue for decades and in the view of the parish, the wind park could only be constructed after the peat deposit is exhausted. Eurowind OÜ filed a complaint to the Tallinn Administrative Court, which rejected it as well as the District Court. \r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court accepted the complaint and ruled that if an area has been dedicated to wind energy development by an area planning, then the administrative body (parish, Land Board or Environmental Board) must do everything reasonable to implement this when deciding upon the approval of design provisions. The Court also considered both the extraction of peat from deposits already in use and the construction of wind turbines to increase wind energy production to be in significant public interest. \r\n\r\nIn the Court’s view, an option whereby wind energy can be produced and peat extracted simultaneously could possibly best satisfy both public interests. Both the parish and the state are obliged to actively assist finding the best solution. Although the developers and the peat extractors have the greatest responsibility in finding a suitable solution, if an agreement is not reached, administrative bodies must take action to balance the different public interests, including amending the peat extraction permits to allow the construction of the wind park.

The plaintiff appealed the decision to the Tallinn Circuit Court which rejected the appeal. \r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court of Estonia considered the appeal and rejected it, but amended the arguments of the courts of lower instances. The Supreme Court ruled that a very broad planning such as the one in question can interfere with a person’s rights and therefore give locus standi, but the Court did not detect a breach of rights in this case. The Court also stated that for a person to claim that wind turbines breach their rights, the wind turbines must be in their immediate vicinity and that a distance of more than 10 kilometres does not amount to it. Additionally, the breach of rights must be greater than merely theoretical. ",

The “Jet Zero” strategy is the UK’s strategy to decarbonise the aviation sector to achieve net zero in aviation by 2050.\r\n\r\nThe strategy is alleged to:\r\n-\tbreach the UK’s Climate Change Act 2008 since the SoS Transport did not ensure that it would enable the UK’s carbon budgets to be met, which would result in a failure to deliver net zero\r\n-\tbreach public law principles, because the SoS Transport a) departed from advice given by the Climate Change Committee (the UK’s statutory advisory body on climate change) on reducing demand without giving lawful reasons, b) did not lawfully consult on the strategy, c) failed to take into account emissions other than CO2 caused by flights.\r\n\r\nGALBA makes an additional argument on the effects of the strategy on local planning applications for airports.\r\n\r\nIt was announced in March 2023 that the two cases will proceed to a joint hearing.\r\n\r\nFollowing the joint hearing on 1-4 April 2025, the High Court dismissed the judicial review challenging the UK’s Jet Zero Strategy regarding aviation.

      "summary": "In 2020, private company Energybuild Ltd applied to the UK Coal Authority to deconditionalise the remaining conditional part of a coal mine licence, relating to a site in Aberpergwm, Wales. The purpose of the application was to expand mining operations. Emissions relating to the proposed expansion were estimated at approximately 100 million tonnes of CO2 from combustion of the coal and 1.17 million tonnes of methane gas, until the license expires in 2039. \r\nIn January 2022, the Coal Authority approved the application, resulting in a public law challenge by Coal Action Network, a group that aims to end coal use within the UK. The challenge was heard by the High Court in March 2023. In May 2023 the claim was dismissed.\r\nThe judge dismissed ground 1. Whilst Welsh Ministers now have the power to approve or decline authorisations for coal mining in Wales, that power was not applicable. The licence in question was granted before the power came into force, and there was a presumption against legislation having retrospective effect which was applied here.\r\nThe judge dismissed ground 2, which alleged the Coal Authority had interpreted its statutory powers too narrowly and, as a result, ignored relevant considerations concerning climate policy and climate impacts. The matters relied on by the claimant were not material to the Coal Authority’s task, which was to determine whether the conditions precedent in the conditional licenses had been fulfilled. The Coal Policy Statement, relied on by the claimant, only expresses what the Welsh Ministers’ intend to do, or not do, in future with respect to coal extraction. The statement was not relevant to the Coal Authority’s limited task of determining whether the conditions precedent were satisfied. Nor were the adverse climate change impacts, and the effect on the Welsh Ministers’ ability to meet their climate change targets, relevant to whether the conditions precedent were satisfied.\r\nCoal Action Network appealed the ground 1 findings, relating to the powers of the Welsh Ministers. The grounds of appeal focussed on whether the legislation had retrospective effect, and on the scope of the mining company’s property rights under the European Convention on Human Rights. The Court of Appeal held, however, that these matters did not arise. The legislation, properly interpreted, did not grant functions on the Welsh Ministers in relation to licences granted prior to the relevant devolution legislation, enacted in 2018. In reaching this conclusion the Court of Appeal saw no proper basis for inferring that the meaning of the devolution legislation was affected by the background against which it was enacted of increased national and international recognition of the importance of efforts to address climate change. There were no legitimate aids to statutory interpretation which indicated that the extent of the devolution powers conferred were to be judged by reference to the national or international context in this way (judgments paragraphs 27, 34 and 47).\r\nIt is not known whether Coal Action Network intend to apply to the Supreme Court for permission to appeal.",

      "type": "case",
      "count": 1,
      "summary": "In January 2023, the two environmental organizations Friends of the Earth (FoE) and South Lakeland Action On Climate Change (SLACC) filed public law challenges to the UK Government’s decision to grant planning permission for a new coking coal mine in the Whitehaven, Cumbria. The decision to grant planning permission was made in December 2022 by the Secretary of State (SoS) for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities, on the recommendation of a planning inspector after a planning inquiry held in 2021. FoE challenged the decision as unlawful on the following grounds:\r\n-\tThe SoS’ conclusion that the mine would be a “net-zero” mine for the purpose of reaching the UK’s Sixth Carbon Budget (covering the period of 2033-37, and as established under the UK’s Climate Change Act 2008) was unlawful. International carbon offset credits, which the mining company undertook to buy to offset the mine’s residual emissions, do not count towards the UK’s carbon budgets.\r\n-\tThe SoS’ failed to lawfully address the international impact of this decision, despite the evidence given on this issue by highly qualified people, like the former chair of the IPCC.\r\n-\tThe SoS erred in his approach to the extent to which the coal would “substitute” for other coal in the global market or be “additional” to it, resulting in the unlawful conclusion that there would be no net emissions increase because of the mine. \r\n-\tFoE also reserved the right to argue a point on the SoS’ approach to downstream emissions, depending on the UK Supreme Court’s decision in R (Finch) v Surrey County Council & ors,  which was heard in June 2023. \r\nSLACC challenged the decision as unlawful on the following grounds:\r\n-\tThe SoS failed to deal with the principal issue of whether or not there would be perfect substitution, which would determine the extent of the climate impact of the mine.\r\n-\tThe SoS failed to deal with the principal issue of the international impact of granting planning consent.\r\n-\tThe SoS incorrectly determined whether downstream emissions are indirect significant environmental effects of the mine.\r\n-\tThe SoS applied a different threshold to the opposing parties’ evidence and arguments at the planning inquiry, and imposed the unlawful burden on the claimant of disproving the mine company’s case.\r\n\r\nIn April 2023 the High Court initially refused both claimants permission to proceed to a full hearing. The claimants exercised their right for that decision to be reconsidered.\r\nIn May 2023, in the days leading up to the permission hearing, the High Court ordered a ‘rolled-up’ hearing of the two challenges. This means the applications for permission would be considered in court with the substantive hearing to follow immediately if permission was granted. At the rolled-up hearing, the judge heard argument on permission and the substance together, giving a single judgment. A three-day hearing was then set for October 2023. However, in July 2023, the High Court vacated the October hearing and stayed the challenges pending the judgment of the Supreme Court in R(on the application of Finch on behalf of the Weald Action Group) v Surrey County Council and others (UKSC 2022/0064).\r\n\r\nIn October 2023, the High Court heard and rejected a disclosure application by Friends of the Earth. The document sought was the advice received by the SoS, from his officials, on whether to grant or refuse planning permission for the mine. In February 2024 the Court of Appeal refused Friends of the Earth permission to appeal against this disclosure decision.\r\n\r\nAlthough it was the 2017 Regulations and not the 2011 Regulations that applied in Finch, all parties accepted that the principles laid down in the Finch decision applied equally to the Whitehaven case. The High Court, therefore, applied the Supreme Court’s majority decision in Finch and found that the decision to grant approval for the coal mine was unlawful. In reaching its decision, the High Court rejected the arguments advanced by the developer of the coal mine that the project would have a zero net increase effect on global GHG emissions because the coal produced would substitute coal that would otherwise be produced in the US. The judgment illustrates how any evidence that a project will have a net zero effect will be subjected to significant scrutiny, particularly if, as in this case, that position is based on substitution. The Whitehaven decision quashes the decision made by the previous Secretary of State in December 2022 to grant planning permission for the coal mine. It is now up to the developer of the mine to decide whether to appeal the judgement and/or maintain its application. If it elects to maintain its application, the government will need to consider again the question of whether to grant approval and, in doing so, would need to take into account the scope 3 emissions that would be generated by the project.",

Plaintiff appealed, and the Tribunal upheld this decision.\r\n\r\nThe Constitutional Court (the Court) decided to exercise its judicial review and overturned the previous decisions. The Court found that the violation of the fundamental rights of the plaintiff and the Afro-Caribbean ethnic group was substantiated, and that some of these violations continued to this day, two years after the hurricane Iota’s devastating pass through the islands. \r\n\r\nThe Court ordered defendants to ensure the protection of the rights of islanders.

The Court explicitly mentioned the obligations under the Paris Agreement (ratified by Colombia and included in the domestic legal framework through Law 1844 of 2017), particularly those obligations related to adaptation measures and efforts towards communities in vulnerable situations. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, the Court cited Resolution 3/21 (issued by the Inter-American Commission of Human Rights and REDESCA) quoting the grave risk countries in the Caribbean experience due to sea level rise and increase in hurricanes and tropical storms. The Court also mentioned the Inter-American Court of Human Rights’ Advisory Opinion 23/17 to underscore the vulnerable situation in which Caribbean communities in Colombia live and the obligation of states to guarantee the right to public participation in decision making, among other environmental human rights.\r\n\r\nThe Court found that the violation of the fundamental rights of the islanders was the result of a lack of compliance by the Colombian government of its domestic and international obligations. The Court issued specific orders to make sure the government’s response is adequate and highlighted that the comprehensive action plan to restore the islands had to consider Colombia’s obligations towards climate change mitigation and adaptation. In the Court’s reasoning, climate change is the biggest threat to the enjoyment of human rights, which extends to mitigation and adaptation measures with a special emphasis on communities in vulnerable situations due to socio-economic and geographic factors.",

      "id": "Austria v. European Commission",
      "type": "case",
      "count": 1,
      "summary": "On October 7, 2022, Austria brought an action against the European Commission. It demanded the General Court annul Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/1214 of 9 March 2022, which qualifies investments in fossil gas and nuclear energy as “environmentally sustainable”. \r\n\r\nIn 2020, the European legislator adopted the Taxonomy Regulation (EU) 2020/852 to direct investments toward sustainable projects and activities. Thereby, investments are considered environmentally sustainable if they involve one or several economic activities that qualify as environmentally sustainable under the criteria provided for in the Taxonomy Regulation. In 2021, the European Commission published Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2021/2139, which specified technical screening criteria to determine whether an economic activity substantially contributes to climate change adaptation and causes no significant harm to other environmental objectives. In 2022, the Commission amended the delegated legal act and released Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/1214, which includes specific activities relating to nuclear energy and fossil gas in the list of activities covered by the EU taxonomy. Nuclear energy and fossil gas investments thus qualify as “environmentally sustainable” investments under the Taxonomy Regulation.\r\n\r\nAustria raised an action for annulment against Delegated Regulation (EU) 2022/1214 for violating primary and secondary EU law. It relied on 16 pleas in law, eight of which relate to nuclear energy, the other eight to fossil gas. Austria claimed a violation of several provisions of Regulation (EU) 2020/852, based on which Regulation (EU) 2022/1214 was adopted, as well as a violation of other (procedural) requirements and primary law. In concrete terms, the following claims were raised: \r\n\r\nFirst, Austria claimed a breach of procedural rules – allegedly, the Commission did not comply with the principles and procedural rules enshrined in Regulation (EU) 2020/852 (Taxonomy Regulation) and the Interinstitutional Agreement on better law-making. In particular, the Commission wrongly omitted to conduct an impact assessment and public consultation. Also, it did not assess the compatibility of Regulation (EU) 2022/1214 with the European Climate Change Act, as required by Art 6 para 4 of the Act. \r\n\r\nSecond, Austria asserted that the Commission was not competent to enact Regulation (EU) 2022/1214. According to the requirement of materiality under Art 290 TFEU, the Union legislature would have had to decide to include nuclear energy in the taxonomy. It did not adopt such a decision; therefore, Austria held that nuclear energy does not qualify as environmentally sustainable under the Taxonomy Regulation. Further, it considered the precautionary principle to be violated. \r\n\r\nWith regard to nuclear energy, Austria asserted that the qualification of nuclear energy as “environmentally sustainable” violates the “do no significant harm-principle” (DNSH principle) pursuant to Art 17 Regulation (EU) 2020/852 as well as the precautionary principle under primary law. The Commission allegedly failed to recognise the risk of significantly impairing protected environmental objectives due to severe reactor accidents and high-level radioactive waste. In addition, Austria asserted a violation of individual requirements for technical screening criteria under Art 19 Regulation (EU) 2020/852 as well as a violation of Art 10 para 2 and Art 11 Regulation (EU) 2020/852. Arguably, nuclear energy does not meet the criteria set out in Art 10 para 2 Regulation (EU) 2020/852 and does not substantially contribute to climate change adaptation as required by Art 11 Regulation (EU) 2020/852. \r\n\r\nIn terms of fossil gas, Austria asserted a violation of the DNSH principle since qualifying fossil gas as “environmentally sustainable” aggravates climate change. Besides, Austria considered Art 10 para 2 Regulation (EU) 2020/852 and the precautionary principle to be violated as technologically and economically feasible low-carbon alternatives to fossil gas, which substantially contribute to climate change mitigation, already exist. In addition, Austria claimed that several of the requirements for technical screening criteria according to Art 19 Regulation (EU) 2020/852 were violated and brought forward a violation of Art 11 Regulation (EU) 2020/852 as economic activities relating to fossil gas do not substantially contribute to climate change adaptation.

They were demanding an end to governmental support of new fossil fuel licences and projects. The 12 hour action meant that the fuel terminal was unable to operate as the protesters gathered within the site and in front of security barriers. The protest was part of a larger action taking place across England in conjunction with Extinction Rebellion. \r\n\r\nThe defendants were sentenced in mid-February 2023 at the Wolverhampton Magistrates Court. Although a guilty verdict was reached for 7 of the 9 defendants, the judge was sympathetic to the cause of the protestors. \r\n\r\nThere was a dispute as to what his sentencing remarks were. According to Just Stop Oil, he said, when noting the defendants’ “admirable aims”, that:\r\n\r\n“When the United Nations Secretary General gives a speech saying that the activity of fossil fuel companies is incompatible with human survival, we should all be very aware of the need for change.” \r\n\r\nThe BBC followed up with an article setting out what the Judicial Office understood to be the judge’s comments. That version was also sympathetic to the defendants however, noting their explanations for their actions were ‘deeply emotive’ which ‘moved’ the judge.\r\n\r\nThe convicted were given a 12-month conditional discharge and ordered to pay costs.

      "type": "case",
      "count": 1,
      "summary": "This claim was brought by the trustees of two charities (the Ashden Trust and the Mark Leonard Trust; “the Claimants”), both of which have environmental protection or improvement as one of their main charitable purposes. The Claimants sought the Court’s approval to adopt an investment strategy that would, as far as practicably possible, exclude investments that did not align with the goals of the Paris Agreement under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), which requires the 195 countries who are party to it to cut greenhouse gas emissions to tackle climate change. Though it is the nation signatories who must comply with the obligations, with private persons and charities not bound to it as such, the Claimants nonetheless chose the Paris Agreement as a benchmark with which to conclude that any investments that do not align with its goals are in direct conflict with their charitable purposes.\r\n\r\nThe Claimants were, however, concerned that adopting such an investment strategy would not be consistent with their fiduciary duties (and thereby be unlawful) as it would exclude many potential investments and may lead to financial detriment (if only in the short term). They therefore sought approval from the High Court to adopt this investment approach.\r\n\r\nTheir claim was defended by the Charity Commission and the Attorney-General. Though they supported the need for the court to clarify the effect of Harries v Church Commissioners for England [1991] 10 WLUK 372 (‘Bishop of Oxford’) and set out the correct approach in law for charity trustees, they argued that it was premature for the court to approve the claimants' investment policies based on the available evidence.\r\n\r\nOn April 29, 2022, the High Court gave judgment, with Green J approving the strategy and deciding that “the Claimants ha[d] exercised their powers of investment properly and lawfully” [Judgment at #88]. \r\n\r\nGreen J set out ten legal principles that summarise the correct approach in law for charity trustees to follow when considering adopting an ethical approach to investment [Judgment at #78]. More specifically, he held that Bishop of Oxford did not lay down an absolute prohibition on making investments that directly conflict with the charity's purposes, and instead confirmed that, “where trustees are of the reasonable view that investments or classes of investment may conflict with the charitable purposes and thereby risk losing donors or damaging the reputation of the charity, the trustees have a discretion as to whether to exclude such investments” [Judgment at #78(6)]. That discretion should be exercised by reasonably balancing all relevant factors, including the extent of the potential conflict against the risk of financial detriment. Green J concluded that, “if that balancing exercise is properly done and a reasonable and proportionate investment policy is thereby adopted, the trustees will have complied with their legal duties” [Judgment at #78(10)]. In this case, Green J considered that the Claimants had sufficiently balanced these factors and so their proposed investment policy was lawful. Green J made the requested declaration that permits charity trustees to adopt a policy that aligns their charities’ investments with their charitable purposes, even though it may risk reducing financial returns.\r\n\r\nOn November 15, 2022, the government issued a formal response to the judgment and its implications for investment guidance. That confirmed the Charity Commission will publish updated guidance by summer 2023.",

      "count": 1,
      "summary": "Ithaca Energy PLC is one of the largest independent oil and gas producers in the UK North Sea, with assets including the Cambo and Rosebank fields. In 2022 it sought, and was  ultimately granted, listing on the London Stock Exchange. \r\n\r\nAs part of that process Ithaca submitted a ‘prospectus’ for approval by the Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”), being the UK’s financial regulator. The FCA may only approve a prospectus if satisfied it meets the requirements of European Union Regulation 2017/1129. This Regulation remains UK law post-Brexit by virtue of Part 6 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. The Regulation, aimed at investor protection, requires companies to disclose certain specific and material risks they face.\r\n\r\nThe FCA approved Ithaca’s prospectus, resulting in a public law claim by ClientEarth, issued in February 2023. \r\n\r\nIn May 2023 the High Court refused permission for the claim to proceed to trial. It made this decision ‘on the papers’. ClientEarth renewed its application, resulting in a permission hearing. \r\n\r\nIn December 2023, following that hearing, the High Court gave judgment. Whilst delay in bringing the claim was not a good reason for refusing permission (judgment paragraphs 4 to 6), and whilst ClientEarth had standing (paragraph 7), the grounds were not arguable and so permission was refused.\r\n\r\nThe FCA had not arguably breached the Regulation. The approval of the prospectus could only be challenged on public law grounds. The Regulation’s requirements were not hard-edged, and determining whether they were met required evaluative judgement, which the court would only interfere with if irrational. Here, the FCA’s interpretation of the Regulation was plainly correct. Whilst the Regulation required disclosure of those risk factors that were material, it did not require the issuer to disclose its assessment of risk and materiality/specificity. The prospectus plainly did address risks to Ithaca's business and securities arising out of climate change factors, associated regulatory measures and changes in consumer use. The FCA considered that the risk factors were adequately described, and there was no arguable error in that decision. (Paragraphs 16 to 26).\r\n\r\nNor was it arguably irrational for the FCA to have concluded, pursuant to the Regulation, that the prospectus contained the necessary information material to an investor for making an informed assessment of Ithaca's financial position and prospects. ClientEarth, relying on FCA guidance on climate change and other ESG-related matters, argued the prospectus did not adequately deal with the potential impacts of the Paris Agreement on Ithica’s business, were it to be fully implemented. The court held, however, that this ground had ‘not come close’ to demonstrating that the FCA had acted irrationally. (Paragraphs 27 to 29.)\r\n\r\nThe court also held that the claim was not one that was caught by the Aarhus Convention. The relevant provisions of the Act and the Regulations were not provisions of national law which related to the environment. As to the nature of the contraventions alleged, there was not a sufficiently close connection to the environmental factors regulated by the Aarhus Convention, and even if the claim succeeded, it would not have significant environmental benefit. ClientEarth did not therefore benefit from the limits on costs recoverable between parties in Aarhus claims. (Paragraphs 30 to 47.)\r\n",

      "type": "case",
      "count": 1,
      "summary": "These challenges concern the legality of the following decisions, all of which relate to the licensing of North Sea oil.\r\n•\tOn Sep. 7, 2022, the UK government adopted its non-statutory Offshore Energy Plan (“the Plan”). This Plan was the subject of a strategic environmental assessment (“SEA”), known as “OESEA4”.\r\n•\tOn Sep. 8, 2022, the government approved the design of its “Climate Compatibility Checkpoint” (“the Checkpoint”). The stated aim of this policy was to ensure that, before a new North Sea oil and gas licensing round is offered, “the compatibility of future licensing with the UK’s climate objectives is evaluated”. In approving the design of this policy, a proposed test was omitted. That test would have considered whether end-use emissions from the combustion of UK oil are expected to fall in line with the 1.5°C temperature target, if further licensing rounds are approved.\r\n•\tOn Sep.16, 2022, the government decided that a further licensing round was compatible with the UK’s climate objectives. That was informed by departmental analysis by reference to the Checkpoint.\r\n•\tOn Oct. 4, 2022, the Oil and Gas Authority (“OGA”) invited applications for offshore oil and gas licenses under section 3 of the Petroleum Act 1998, in what is known as the 33rd Offshore Oil and Gas Licensing Round. The OGA is a company wholly owned by the UK government which, since March 2022, has traded under the name “The North Sea Transition Authority”.\r\nThese decisions were challenged in public law claims issued in December 2022 by environmental charities Greenpeace and Uplift. In April 2023 both claims were granted permission to proceed to trial. In July 2023 they were heard. In October 2023 the High Court dismissed both claims, rejecting all the grounds of challenge:\r\n•\tThe decision in OESEA4 not to assess end-use emissions from further oil and gas licensing rounds was rational. There was no breach of the relevant SEA regulations. Whilst the leading case of R(Finch) v Surrey County Council [2022] EWCA Civ 187 concerned environmental impact assessment, not SEA, the factual context and the two regimes were sufficiently analogous that important parts of the Finch analysis were applicable. Here the Plan only set the framework for licensing oil and gas exploration and production in the North Sea. It did not set the framework for downstream development such as refinement and storage. The end-use emissions from uses of the extracted oil and gas were not therefore “likely significant effects” of the Plan under the SEA regulations. Further, it was lawful for the government to conclude there was an insufficient causal connection between new oil and gas licensing and end-use emissions, and to decline to assess such emissions on that basis also. (Judgment, paragraphs 89 to 116.)\r\n•\tThe government did not fail to properly to assess “reasonable alternatives” under the SEA regulations. That failure was said by the claimants to have resulted from a failure to properly assess the alternative of not proceeding with further licensing. However, to the extent this entailed arguments about market substitution, these did not arise given end-use emissions were not assessed. As to assessments of production emissions, these were matters of judgement. Nor was it unlawful for the government to have concluded that imports would have a higher emissions intensity than UK-produced hydrocarbons. (Judgment, paragraphs 117 to 136.)\r\n•\tThe reasons for omitting the end-use emissions test from the Checkpoint were lawful and rational. It was also rational for the government to rely on the Checkpoint when adopting the Plan and deciding the new licensing round was compatible with the UK’s climate objectives. The Checkpoint is not a statutory plan or policy. It is an informative, non-binding document to assist ministers in deciding whether to support or not support a further licensing round. It was a matter of judgement for the Secretary of State as to whether he considered there to be an appropriate test or benchmark for taking scope 3 emissions into account on a decision whether or not to support a new licensing round. (Judgment, paragraphs 137 to 150.)\r\n•\tThe failure to publish reasons for deciding a new licensing round would be compatible with the Checkpoint and the UK’s climate objectives was not unlawful. There was no common law duty to give reasons. (Judgment, paragraphs 151 to 158.)\r\n•\tFurther grounds of challenge related to the OGA’s decision to carry out the 33rd licensing round necessarily failed, given the findings above (judgment, paragraphs 58 and 159).\r\nIt is not known whether the claimants intend to appeal to the Court of Appeal.",

It also seeks the annulment of the (i) water resources use right grants and (ii) Water Availability Reserve Certificates referring to the Macaé and Ostras River Hydrographic Basin, granted by INEA for the same projects. The plaintiff institution argues that the installation of a thermoelectric complex in the region, consisting of eighteen enterprises, is contrary to the need for investment in a clean energy matrix and the fight against climate change. It argues that there should be a determination that licensing agencies require, prior to issuing licenses: (i) a Strategic Environmental Assessment (AAE) for the analysis of synergistic and cumulative impacts of enterprises to be installed in the same hydrographic basin; (ii) the updating of the plan of the Hydrographic Basin of the Macaé and Ostras River and the study of water availability of the Basin; and (iii) the presentation of a Climate Diagnosis, with an inventory of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions by the enterprises.\r\n\r\nThe plaintiff argues that the failure to conduct AAE prior to the issuance of the licenses invalidates the administrative procedures already carried out, since it was not possible to investigate the various cumulative impacts of the activities to be licensed. It is emphasized that emissions of pollutants by thermoelectric plants contribute to air pollution, damage to human health, and loss of agricultural productivity. From the climatic point of view, it is argued that in order to keep the limit of planetary temperature increase at 1.5°C, to fulfill the commitments made in the Paris Agreement, COP 26 and NDCs, the installation of new enterprises that use fossil fuels cannot be allowed. The plaintiff highlights the consolidation of jurisprudence favorable to environmental and climate issues at the Supreme Federal Court, exemplified by the judgment of ADPF 708 (Climate Fund), which recognizes that current Brazilian measures to address climate change are in disagreement with its international commitments. The plaintiff requests, as a preliminary injunction the suspension of the environmental licensing processes of the plants until the defects in the Environmental Impact Studies (EIA/RIMAs) and the defects related to atmospheric dispersions are remedied, including, among others (i) the determination that the Climate Diagnosis be presented and considered for the analysis of the environmental licensing processes, (ii) IBAMA be ordered to include the guidelines set forth in the National Policy on Climate Change (PNMC), the guidelines of the Rio de Janeiro State Policy on Climate Change, and the preparation of a AAE in the terms of reference of the licensing processes for the power plants and (iii) the companies be ordered to refrain from construction work and activities at the thermoelectric complex until the AAE, basin plan update, hydric availability study, and other studies required in the lawsuit have been conducted. In the final stage, it is requested that the preliminary injunction be confirmed, reiterating the requests, with the inclusion of the requirements for the annulment of the environmental licensing processes, licenses and permits already granted by the environmental agencies. \r\n\r\nIBAMA, the Federal Government, Litos Energia Ltda, Usina Termelétrica Norte Fluminense S.A, the State of Rio de Janeiro, INEA and Global Participações filed answers. In relation to climate aspects, IBAMA argued that the terms of reference used for the licensing of the project included the need for a synergistic assessment of atmospheric gas emissions from existing plants and those to be implemented.

The plaintiff informs that INEA, when granting the Integrated environmental license disregarded the synergistic and cumulative impacts with the request for a license to install and operate four floating Thermoelectric Plants in the same region, which are part of the same project. It argues that both the temporary towers for power transmission lines and the floating Thermoelectric Plants should be analyzed together and that there was an absence of an Environmental Impact Study/Environmental Impact Report (EIA/RIMA) and of a public hearing with the participation of the local community. The MPF points out that thermoelectric enterprises are generators of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) pollution. For this reason, INEA should require prior studies to assess the contribution of the project to climate change, taking into account the objectives of the National Policy on Climate Change - PNMC (Federal Law 12.189/2009) and the goals assumed by Brazil in the Paris Agreement.It raises the special protection of the Atlantic Forest biome (under Federal Law 11.428/2006) when it comes to suppression of vegetation. The MPF bases its claim on the duty of the Public Authorities to defend and preserve the ecologically balanced environment provided for in article 225 of the Federal Constitution. \r\n\r\nAmong other measures, the plaintiff requests the preliminary suspension of the license and, definitively, the: (i) declaration of its nullity; (ii) evaluation of the project considering its contribution to climate change, so as to ensure that emissions are mitigated; (iii) determination that INEA abstain from granting licenses without conducting an EIA; (iv) determination that INEA considers, after the presentation of the EIA/RIMA, the global analysis of the licensing, considering the cumulative and synergistic effects of the projects; (v) determination that the defendants to recover the already deforested areas and the existing environmental liabilities; and (vi) determination that the defendants compensate for the damages caused, considering their material and extra-patrimonial nature, including collective moral damages.\r\n\r\nOn September 25, 2022, the judge dismissed the case without resolution of the merits, on procedural grounds. It emphasized that the case should be dismissed on the grounds of (i) lack of standing to sue on the part of the Federal Public Prosecutor's Office (MPF); (ii) absolute lack of jurisdiction of the court; and (iii) lack of interest in suing on the grounds of inadequacy of the chosen legal avenue.",

      "summary": "In 2016, an Italian NGO (Altroconsumo), representing over 63,000 individuals who had bought Volkswagen, Audi, Seat and Skoda vehicles in the relevant period, started a class action against Volkswagen Aktiengesellschaft and Volkswagen Group Italia S.p.A (\"VWAG\" and \"VWGI\", together \"Volkswagen\") before the Court of Venice, seeking a declaration that they engaged in unfair commercial practices against Italian consumers. The case is the Italian spin-off of the so called \"Dieselgate scandal\" which exploded in 2015, when the [US] Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) notified the German carmaker an alleged emissions standard violation. It was later discovered that, between 2009 and 2015, Volkswagen had employed a particular piece of software (the so-called defeat device) that allowed some vehicles with diesel engines to pass emissions standards test that they would otherwise have failed.\r\nThe Italian class action followed the decision of the Italian Competition Authority (\"ICA\"), which held Volkswagen liable for unfair commercial practices under articles 20, 21 and 23 of the Italian Consumers Code and issued a fine of € 5 million (see, Italian Competition Authority v. Volkswagen Aktiengesellschaft and Volkswagen Group Italia S.p.A, which is still ongoing.\r\n\r\nAltroconsumo claimed that Volkswagen (i) falsely stated the level of the polluting emissions of Volkswagen-branded EA 189 diesel vehicles (by installing the so-called defeat device to falsify the result of the emission tests) and (ii) engaged in advertising campaigns presenting its vehicles as having specific green features able to protect the environment by reducing CO2 emissions: such \"green claims\" were false and deceptive, and constituted a misleading commercial practice prohibited by the Unfair Commercial Practice Directive no. 2005/29/CE (implemented in Italy by Legislative Decree no. 145/2007). Altroconsumo therefore argued that Italian consumers' right to freedom of contract was breached and that they had suffered direct financial loss, equal to the decrease in value of the vehicle(s) they have bought because it did not possess the promised green qualities.\r\n\r\nVolkswagen denied Altroconsumo's allegations and raised a series of preliminary objections which were all rejected.\r\nThe Court of first instance upheld Altroconsumo's claims and found that the defendants were responsible for using misleading, and at times false, \"green claims\" in their marketing and advertising activities. The Court awarded damages, amounting to Euro 3,000 for each member of the class action in financial damage, plus Euro 300 in moral damage (over Euro 200M in total), plus legal expenses. According to the Court of first instance, Volkswagen's conduct potentially misled consumers and such potential effect was enough to draw a causal link between Volkswagen's behaviour and the damage suffered by the consumers, as it was presumed – in the absence of evidence to the contrary – that consumers were influenced in their commercial choices by Volkswagen's 'green claims'. To reach its conclusions, the Court of first instance relied on reasoning expressed by the Italian Supreme Court in prospectus liability cases where a similar presumption applies.\r\n\r\nVolkswagen appealed the decision issued by the Court of first instance before the Court of Appeal of Venice. With decision published on 16 November 2023, the Court confirmed the existence of unfair and deceptive business practices perpetrated by Volkswagen, although it partially upheld Volkswagen's appeal in relation to the pecuniary damages. In particular, the Court did not deem proven the pecuniary damage, already liquidated by the Court in euros 3,000.00 for each consumer, considering the free corrective actions offered by the manufacturer.\r\nOn the other end, the Court of Appeal confirmed the amount of non-pecuniary damages for euro 300.00 for each of the 63,136 consumers opted in the class action.\r\n \r\nThe decision is not final and binding yet, as the parties has 6 months starting from the publication to appeal it before the Supreme Court.",

      "summary": "On May 9, 2023, 12 Italian citizens and 2 NGOs (Greenpeace Italy, and ReCommon) filed a lawsuit against the fossil fuel company ENI S.p.A. (\"ENI\") for its contribution to global warming. The lawsuit also includes ENI's two majority shareholders, namely the Italian Ministry of Economy and Finance (\"MEF\") and Cassa Depositi e Prestiti S.p.A. (\"CDP\"), which have the power to strongly influence the company's policies. The case is built on the landmark decision Milieudefensie et al. v. Royal Dutch Shell plc, which ordered Shell to reduce its emissions by 45% by 2030, relative to 2019, across all activities including both its own emissions and end-use emissions. According to the claimants, ENI’s own decarbonization strategy is not in line with the goals enshrined in the Paris Agreement and the best available climate science recommendations to limit climate impacts. It is alleged that ENI's conduct not only contributes to climate change, with all that it entails in terms of environmental risks and health consequences, it also violates human rights that are safeguarded and protected both by the Italian Constitution and by international norms and agreements. Besides, MEF and CDP are also deemed responsible for ENI's climate inaction, as, thanks to the ENI's shares held directly and indirectly, they have sufficient votes to exercise a dominant influence in the Ordinary Shareholders' Meeting of ENI, which is equivalent to a situation of \"control\" of the State over the same company participated.\r\n\r\nOn the basis of the above, the claimants are asking the Court of Rome to declare ENI, MEF and CDP jointly and severally liable for past and potential future damages to fundamental rights, such as the right to health, safety, and property and for putting, and continuing to put, in danger the same assets of the applicants because of the consequences of climate change.\r\n\r\nClaimants are also seeking an order against ENI MEF and CDP to adopt an industrial strategy to reduce the climate-changing CO2 emissions associated with its operations by 45% by 2030 against the company’s 2020 baseline, in line with the requirements of the Paris Agreement. The claimants request the application of the new astreinte tool, asking to condemn ENI to pay a monetary sum to be determined by the judge for any violation or non-compliance with or delay in the execution of the obtaining order. No claim for the actual damages suffered by the 12 citizens or others is sought. \r\n\r\nDuring the proceedings, the respondents invoked the Court’s ‘absolute lack of jurisdiction’, particularly citing the recent decision in A Sud et al. v. Italy (https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/a-sud-et-al-v-italy/)  – in which the Court had declared the applicants’ claims inadmissible on the grounds of absolute lack of jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nOn June 10, 2024, the applicants decided to petition the Civil Court of Rome to stay the proceedings as they filed an appeal for a regulation of jurisdiction. This legal instrument allows a party to request that the Court of Cassation (Supreme Court of Italy) determine the jurisdiction. The Civil Court of Rome granted the stay, suspending the trial and referring the matter of admissibility of the civil proceedings to the Supreme Court of Cassation. \r\n\r\nThe Court of Cassation will now have the opportunity to rule on the procedural admissibility of climate change litigation cases in Italy.",

(Miko), before the Court of Gorizia (a town in the North of Italy). According to Al, Miko advertised its suede-like microfiber product to the public as having many green features and promoted it as environmentally friendly. The \"green claims\" made by the Miko included statements such as \"made of recycled polyester\", \"environmentally friendly”, “natural choice”, “eco-friendly microfiber”, “the first and only microfiber that guarantees environmental sustainability throughout the productive cycle”, “the first sustainable and recyclable microfiber”, “100% recyclable”, “100% recyclable at the end of its lifecycle”, “reduction of energy consumption and GHG emissions by 80%”, “reduction of carbon footprint through polyester recycling”, “absence of harmful substances”, “use of non-harmful dyes”, and “use of neutral and non-toxic dyes”.\r\n\r\nAl argued that Miko's \"green claims\" constituted an act of unfair competition under Article 2598, §3 of the Italian Civil Code in the form of misleading advertising as defined in the Unfair Commercial Practice Directive no. 2005/29/CE (implemented in Italy by Legislative Decree no. 145/2007), alleging that the claims were vague, false, non-verified or non-verifiable.

Defendants in this case are the private companies that are implementing REDD+ projects in their territory and the environmental authorities in charge of authorizing and monitoring the projects. \r\n\r\nPlaintiffs argue that the REDD+ projects violate their fundamental and human rights as a result of (i) a lack of human rights due diligence by the private companies, and (ii) the failure of the government to protect their rights. Plaintiffs contend that all climate change mitigation and adaptation measures, projects and programs must protect and ensure the enjoyment of Indigenous fundamental rights in their respective territories. Particularly, plaintiffs claim that the Colombian legal framework ought to incorporate human rights’ standards regarding the implementation of REDD+ projects to ensure mitigation measures that aim towards environmental protection do not violate human rights. Likewise, plaintiffs assert that due diligence conducted by the private companies must include human rights’ standards, which was not the case. Plaintiffs argue that the private companies deliberatively ignored and excluded the Indigenous authorities.\r\n\r\nThe case was first heard by a judge, who rejected the plaintiffs’ arguments. The judge’s reasoning is based on the subsidiary nature of the tutela mechanism, which is an expedite procedure only available in case regular mechanisms are inadequate to ensure the protection of the plaintiffs’ rights. The judge found that the plaintiffs have indeed other judicial mechanisms to challenge the defendants’ actions and declared that the tutela was not adequate in this case. Plaintiffs filed an appeal and the Administrative Tribunal upheld the judge’s decision. \r\n\r\nOn April 28, 2023, the Colombian Constitutional Court (the Court) exercised its judicial review and selected this case for review. The case will now be heard by the Court’s Justices, who will have the opportunity to study the REDD+ projects for the first time, in what could become a precedent for other carbon emission and climate change mitigation activities particularly regarding Indigenous communities’ rights. The Court deemed it important to provide a clear judicial guideline as to the way these and similar projects are being implemented as well as whether the tutela is the adequate mechanism to challenge the projects, especially with regard to Indigenous rights.\r\n\r\nOn June 25, 2024, the Constitutional Court found that the plaintiffs' rights to self-determination, cultural integrity, autonomous governing and territory had been violated. The Court found that the private companies charged with developing the project failed to exercise due diligence by failing to (i) include domestic and international human rights standards, (ii) obtain free, prior and informed consent, and (iii) effectively monitor the potential harms derived from the project. The Court also underscored the importance of applying an ethnic perspective to all REDD+ projects to ensure the protection of Indigenous rights.\r\n\r\nThe Court acknowledged the importance of REDD+ projects in the fight against climate change. The Court stated that these projects constitute a viable option for sustainable forest management as well as Indigenous communities' governance, if done adequately. The Court ordered an open dialogue so Indigenous peoples can decide whether and if so, how to implement the REDD+ project in their territory in a way that guarantees the protection of their rights. Further, the Court ordered the creation and implementation of a protocol for future projects that applies an ethnic perspective and allows for monitoring the implementation of REDD+ projects in Indigenous and collective territories.",

The complainant referred to the District Court of the Hague's judgment on May 26, 2021 in Milieudefensie et al. v. Royal Dutch Shell plc. to highlight Shell's intentions.

Lastly, Shell stated that the rainforest was an example of the CO2 compensation programs. The RCC held that the slogan could be interpreted in various ways, and that it was unclear that it only referred to the truck. The RCC considered the slogan to be misleading as the cargo (fossil fuel) and the company itself were not CO2 neutral.

The complainant argued that such claims implied that the milk had no effect on the climate. Because this environmental claim could not be substantiated, it allegedly violated articles 2 and 3 of the Code for Environmental Advertising (MRC). The Committee was of the view that an average consumer would interpret these claims in the sense that the production of the products had no impact on the climate in that adverse affects were completely cancelled out. The Committee referred to a previous ruling on Shell \"Drive CO2 neutral\" 1. After giving the defendant the opportunity to provide more information in an interim decision, the Committee found that Arla had not demonstrated the absolute certainty required with regard to the full and permanent offsetting of emissions through its forest projects. Thus, the accuracy of an absolute claim such as \"climate neutral\" had not been demonstrated as required by article 3 MRC. The advertising was therefore in breach of article 2 MRC. Arla subsequently appealed this decision, arguing that it met all the established and highest standards for claiming climate neutrality. Specifically, Arla stated that its \"climate neutral\" claim was a relative and not an absolute one, as the claim related to a label and that it was entitled to use this label for its products. Therefore, Arla argued that this case differentiated from previous cases which had involved absolute claims. The appeal body confirmed the decision of the RCC in part. It found that Arla's statements were misleading to the extent that there was no clarification that the claim specifically related to the label. Thus, the appeal body found the statements to be misleading within article 2 MRC and in conjunction with article 8.3(a),(c) of the Dutch Advertising Code.

Because the claims were admissible on the basis of the foregoing, the Committee did not have to examine the question whether Chiquita was able to demonstrate the correctness of its absolute environmental claim pursuant to article 3 MRC. However, the Committee did refer to the strict standards set out in previous rulings.",

      "summary": "Students for Climate Solutions New Zealand and the UK Youth Climate Coalition have submitted a request to the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court to open an investigation against BP Senior Executives. The submission argues that BP Senior Executives allegedly committed a crime against humanity by knowingly causing and perpetuating climate change while pursuing activities in the oil and gas industry. The submission alleges that since the 1950s, BP Senior Executives have been aware of the climate implications of the corporation’s oil and gas activities because of internal studies conducted into\r\ngreenhouse gases. The results of these studies have allegedly been withheld from the public. The submission further argues that as of the 1990s, BP Senior Executives have admitted their role in perpetuating climate change in company documentaries where a link was made between the corporation’s activities and climate change. In prioritizing profits from oil activities, BP Senior Executives are alleged to have engaged in the following harmful behaviors:\r\n- Creating doubt by sowing distrust in climate change science\r\n- Entrenching dependency on BP’s petroleum products on the false pretense that they are a necessary and viable solution to climate change\r\n- Causing delays to urgent climate policy by portraying climate change as a far-future issue\r\n- Fostering deception of governments and the wider public through misleading marketing of BP as a renewable energy company, using strategic communications to shift responsibilities for carbon emissions onto individuals, and promoting false solutions, such as yet-to-be- invented technology, that prolong the use of fossil fuels\r\n- Ensuring dominance through attempts to control and influence political processes via systematic lobbying and campaign financing.\r\n\r\nThe submission seeks damages from BP Senior Executives, pursuant to Article 8 of the Paris Agreement, for their role in the issue of climate change.",

      "summary": "On October 27, 2010, the Public Prosecutor's Office of Mato Grosso filed a Public Civil Action (class action) against Nelson Noboru Yabuta, aiming to hold him accountable for environmental damage caused by the degradation of native vegetation. The lawsuit sought urgent injunctive relief, environmental regularization of the Luana I and II farms, and compensation for collective moral damages. The plaintiff accused Yabuta of illegally deforesting 119,584 hectares in a Permanent Preservation Area (APP), in Juara, Mato Grosso, without authorization from the environmental agency.\r\n\r\nAn initial injunction was issued, prohibiting any unlicensed activities on the farms. Subsequently, the court ruled in favor of the plaintiff, ordering Yabuta to pay 20,000 Brazilian Reais (about USD $4,000) as compensation for collective moral damages resulting from the environmental harm. Both parties appealed. Yabuta argued that the Infraction Notice, which was one of the foundations of the lawsuit, had been annulled. The plaintiff contended that the court should recognize the obligations outlined in the Conduct Adjustment Agreement, a pact made between Yabuta and the state environmental agency, to strengthen its enforcement.\r\n\r\nOn February 21, 2017, the Court of Justice of Mato Grosso dismissed the appeals, upholding Yabuta's conviction and his responsibility to compensate for collective moral damages. The court emphasized that the cancellation of the administrative infraction notice did not absolve him of liability in other domains, as environmental crimes entail triple liability—criminal, administrative, and civil. It was proven that Yabuta had unlawfully deforested the APP and Legal Reserve of the property, disregarding the necessary authorization. His actions, driven by cattle-raising activities, posed a risk of forest desertification, thereby compromising the quality of life for the local population due to climate change and excessive greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs).",

      "count": 1,
      "summary": "On May 8, 2023, three youth climate activists initiated administrative proceedings before the Council of State (Danıştay), requesting the annulment of Türkiye’s Updated First Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), submitted to the UNFCCC Secretariat on April 13, 2023, naming the Presidency of Türkiye and the Ministry of Environment, Urbanization and Climate Change as respondents.\r\nThe claimants argued that the Updated NDC, which pledges a 41% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 (relative to a Business-as-Usual scenario based on 2012 emissions), is unscientific, inadequate, and inconsistent with Türkiye’s obligations under the Paris Agreement. They further alleged violations of fundamental rights, including the right to life, the right to a healthy and balanced environment, intergenerational equity, and the rights enshrined in the Turkish Constitution, the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, and the European Convention on Human Rights.\r\n\r\nThe plaintiffs contended that the Updated NDC constitutes an administrative act producing legal effects within the domestic legal order and is therefore subject to judicial review.\r\n \r\nDecision of the First Instance Court\r\n\r\nOn June 16, 2023 (E:2023/2600, K:2023/3568), the Council of State (10th Chamber) rejected the case without examination on the merits, concluding that the NDC does not constitute a justiciable administrative act. The court held that:\r\n\"\"The NDC, being a commitment under the Paris Agreement, does not directly affect the national legal order. It merely outlines future regulatory intentions and, as such, does not qualify as an administrative act subject to annulment proceedings.\"\"\r\n \r\nGrounds of Appeal\r\n\r\nThe claimants appealed to the Council of State Administrative Litigation Chambers Assembly. They submitted that:\r\n1.        The NDC, although derived from international obligations, constitutes a concrete and binding roadmap affecting national policy and regulatory frameworks. It thus qualifies as an executive administrative act.\r\n2.        Under Article 90 of the Constitution, international agreements duly put into effect have the force of law, and actions taken pursuant to such agreements must be open to judicial review.\r\n3.        Excluding the NDC from judicial oversight would allow the executive to shield climate-related administrative decisions from legal accountability, despite their concrete impact on citizens' rights and environmental governance.\r\n \r\nOpinion of the Investigating Judge\r\n\r\nThe investigating judge issued a non-binding opinion supporting the claimants' position, arguing that:\r\n•        Administrative actions separable from the core domain of international relations—such as decisions regarding licensing decisions or tenders—may be reviewed on the merits.\r\n•        The NDC, while rooted in international law, represents its domestic implementation. It is not an integral part of the Paris Agreement but a unilateral declaration of national policy based on treaty obligations.\r\n•        As such, the Updated NDC should be classified as a definitive and mandatory administrative act, amenable to judicial review.\r\n \r\nFinal Decision of the Council of State Assembly\r\n\r\nOn June 4, 2024 (E:2024/84, K:2024/1253), the Council of State Administrative Litigation Chambers Assembly dismissed the appeal and denied the request for an oral hearing. The Assembly concluded that the first-instance decision was legally and procedurally sound and that the appeal grounds did not justify reversal.\r\n \r\nDissenting Opinion: Application of the Detachable Acts Theory\r\n\r\nA dissenting judge issued a reasoned opinion invoking the Ayrılabilir İşlemler Kuramı, which posits that administrative acts separable from the domain of foreign affairs—but adopted in implementation of international treaties—are subject to domestic judicial review, provided they are separable from the treaty itself and produce legal effects within the domestic legal order, arguing:\r\n\r\n•        The Paris Agreement itself is not subject to judicial review; however, acts taken to implement its obligations domestically—such as the adoption of an NDC—may be reviewed if they are detachable and have legal effect.\r\n•        The NDC establishes a specific trajectory for national GHG emissions, defines a timeline, and serves as the basis for future legislation and administrative enforcement. It thereby alters the national legal landscape.\r\n•        The NDC is not an annex to the Paris Agreement but a standalone executive act taken in furtherance of it. It meets the criteria of a definitive and executable administrative act separable from the treaty itself.\r\n•        Permitting judicial review of such acts does not intrude upon the domain of international relations but safeguards constitutional principles, including legality, accountability, and the protection of fundamental rights.\r\n\r\nThe dissent concluded that the plaintiffs’ appeal should have been granted, the first-instance decision overturned, and the matter remanded for examination on the merits.\r\n \r\nThis case marks the first domestic legal challenge to Türkiye’s climate commitments under the Paris Agreement. While the majority upheld a narrow interpretation of justiciability, the dissent’s invocation of the Detachable Acts Theory contributed to the debate about the interface between international climate obligations and domestic administrative law.",

The plaintiffs seek the suspension and subsequent annulment of the environmental licensing process of the Portocem Thermoelectric Plant (UTE), powered by natural gas, which is to be installed in the Pecém Industrial and Port Complex (CIPP). They claim there is non-compliance with legal norms and several omissions in the Environmental Impact Study (EIA), including (i) the concealment of indigenous communities in the vicinity of the project, (ii) the disregard of impacts related to water resources, (iii) the disregard of potential socioeconomic impacts, (iv) the underestimation of damage to health, and (v) the disregard of climate impacts. They also believe that there was no adequate analysis of synergistic and cumulative impacts with other enterprises in the region, considering their insertion in an Industrial Complex. In relation to climate impacts, the plaintiffs argue that the EIA failed to list important consequences for climate stability. They mention the reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and how the use of fossil fuels is incompatible with the guiding principles of the national energy policy. They argue that Brazil and the state of Ceará have made a legal commitment to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, which goes against the implementation of a new gas-fired thermoelectric plant. The plaintiffs also point out that the Northeast is one of the regions in Brazil most vulnerable to climate change and stress the importance of the risk analysis of the project to the water security of the region, considering that the water resources of the Northeast are under pressure from climate change. On top of the problems in the impact assessment, the plaintiffs also state flaws in the licensing process due to the lack of effective public participation. In this sense, they question the lack of prior, free, and informed consultation with the indigenous Anacé people. They believe that there was a violation of national and international norms of indigenous peoples' rights, especially Convention 169 of the International Labor Organization (ILO). \r\n\r\nIn light of these various irregularities, the plaintiffs request, in an injunction, the suspension of the installation license granted by SEMACE as well as the determination that Portocem Energia S.A. refrain from starting the implementation work. On these merits, they request that the licensing process be declared null and void and that a new environmental licensing process be conducted with the presentation of a new EIA that corrects the flaws pointed out and includes prior, free, informed and good faith consultation with the affected indigenous peoples.\r\n\r\nA preliminary decision was handed down dismissing the injunction for lack of urgency and probability of the right. However, a decision on the merits is still pending.\r\n\r\nIn July 2023, the defendants filed their defenses. They argued that environmental licensing was regularly held. \r\n\r\nA final decision on the merits is still pending.",

The NHRC dismissed the petition, but later commissioned an investigation on the impact of climate change on human rights in July 2021 on its own. In January 2023, the NHRC, for the first time, issued its opinion on the climate crisis and human rights addressed to the President and the Government.\r\n\r\nThe NHRC opined that the state should recognize the protection and promotion of the human rights of all people in the context of the climate crisis as a fundamental obligation of the state and improve relevant laws and regulations to ensure that the climate crisis is approached from a human rights perspective. Specifically, the NHRC recognized that the individual fundamental rights violated by the climate crisis are virtually all human rights, including the right to life, the right to food, the right to sanitation, the right to health, the right to housing, the right to self-determination, and the right to education.\r\n\r\nThe NHRC also pointed out that the Framework Act On Carbon Neutrality And Green Growth For Coping With Climate Crisis (“Carbon Neutrality Act”) does not provide specific support measures for climate-vulnerable groups, and it urged the government to take comprehensive measures to protect climate-vulnerable groups and strengthen their adaptive capacity. According to Article 8 of the Carbon Neutrality Act, the nationally determined contribution (NDC) is to reduce GHG emissions by at least 35% of 2018 emissions by 2030. Article 3 of the Enforcement Decree of the same Act raises the NDC to 40% of 2018 emissions. However, the NHRC noted that even the enhanced NDC falls short of the reduction target set out in the IPCC's Sixth Assessment Report in 2022 (43% of 2019 emissions by 2030). In addition, the Carbon Neutrality Act does not\r\nspecify GHG reduction targets beyond 2030, which could lead to intergenerational inequities in GHG reductions. The NHRC required the government to set additional GHG reduction targets. \r\n\r\nAlthough the opinion of the NHRC does not bind the Government, this decision is the first opinion issued by a governmental body stating that the state bears an obligation to mitigate climate change, and that the current response is insufficient to protect the human rights of its people.",

      "summary": "On January 24, 2018, the Friends of Nature Institute (FON) sued the State-owned enterprise, Ningxia State Grid for its high abandonment rate of wind and solar power in violation of Articles 2 and 14 of the Renewable Energy Law. Article 2 provides a definition of \"renewables,\" and Article 14 requires that the grid companies \"purchase all electricity generated from renewable energy sources\" and \"provide connection service.\"\r\n\r\nIn this case, Ningxia State Grid failed to purchase all electricity generated by wind and solar energy. Based on that, FON claimed that Defendant should (a) purchase all electricity generated from renewable energy sources within its grid’s coverage; (b) invest 5% of its annual revenue in renewable energy development for five consecutive years; (c) disclose information related to clean energy consumption; (d) offer a public apology; and (e) bear all of the plaintiff’s litigation costs. All of the FON’s allegations were denied by Ningxia State Grid.\r\n\r\nOn April 4, 2023, the Court ruled that Ningxia State Grid did not violate Article 14 of the Renewable Energy Law and dismissed the majority of the FON’s claims. The Court first confirmed that the State Grid has the general obligation to protect the environment in accordance with the law, regulation, and business standards. However, the Court found that the defendant has met its specific obligation in purchasing wind and solar power. According to the Measures for the Guaranteed Full Purchase of Renewable Electric Power issued by the National Development and Reform\r\nCommission on March 24, 2016, grid companies are required to \"purchase all electricity\" under Article 14 only if the electricity consumption is safe. Ningxia State Grid has met its renewable energy consumption target, which was confirmed by The Reply Letter Related to FON v. Ningxia State Grid from the Development and Reform Commission of Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region on April 1, 2021. Meanwhile, the Court understood that the enterprise must continue to use coal-fired electricity to assure grid stability because the production of wind and photovoltaic energy is characterized by randomness, intermittency, and volatility. In addition, the Court observed that renewable resources are primarily concentrated in the western region of the country, geographically distant from the power load center situated in the eastern part. Consequently, achieving complete local utilization of these resources poses a significant challenge.\r\n\r\nHowever, the Court also stressed that the State Grid still has social responsibility for facilitating the use of the renewables and shall effectively implement its low-carbon transition plans under the scrutiny of responsible governmental agencies. Also, the Court affirmed FON’s active participation in environmental litigation. In light of the public interest character of the plaintiff's lawsuit and the defendant’s social responsibility, the court ordered Ningxia State Grid to cover 350,000 RMB (49,000 USD) of the plaintiff’s litigation costs.\r\n\r\nThe FON has appealed.",

Thus, it seeks reparation for environmental damages provoked by it, including (i) the damage caused to flora and fauna, (ii) soil erosion, (iii) contribution to global warming. As for the climate damage, it claims that the unlawful conduct not only removed carbon sinks from the forest, but also caused the release of carbon into the atmosphere. \r\n\r\nThe plaintiff seeks redress through the determination of (i) an obligation to restore the vegetation in an area equivalent to that estimated by IBAMA, based on the volume of logs seized, amounting to 14.90763 hectares, ideally in an area of the same biome in Indigenous Land, Conservation Unit or Agrarian Reform Settlement Project and (ii) an obligation to pay the climate damage based on the Carbon Social Cost (CSC) in the amount of R$1,447,650.20. It claims, based on the polluter pays principle, that the climate damage represents an external social cost that is not internalized by the illegal deforestation, leaving it to society. It also argues that climate damage can be quantified on an individual scale by multiplying the estimated GHG emissions of the activity by the CSC. In this case, IBAMA uses the Amazon Fund methodology to estimate emissions based on the area of the Amazon biome considered deforested, summing up to 5,471.0892 tons of carbon.\r\n\r\nThe plaintiff requests, as an injunction: (i) suspension of financing and tax incentives and access to credit lines by the offender, (ii) unavailability of assets in the estimated amount for the obligation of the vegetation restorage and the obligation to compensate the climate damage, and (iii) judicial restraint order of the illicit polluting activity. On the merits, it requests the defendant's conviction in the obligation to do - to recover an area equivalent to that deforested - and the obligation to pay - in the amount related to the social cost of carbon.\r\n\r\nIn its response, the defendant preliminarily alleged passive illegitimacy due to lack of evidence relating the defendant to the deforestation and the ineptitude of the initial petition. He also claimed the absence of liability for lack of evidence that the defendant was to blame for the damage, in addition to not having any interference over the area where the alleged deforestation was carried out.\r\n\r\nSubsequently, a judgment was delivered upholding the claims. The defendant's arguments were refuted and it was affirmed that the infraction notice was coated with the requirements of validity and delineates the environmental damage. The allegation of passive illegitimacy was also refuted, stating that, in the environmental field, civil liability of a purely objective nature prevails. Thus, the defendant was condemned (i) to make an obligation to recover the area, and to prepare and comply with a reforestation project for the deforested area, under penalty of a fine, and (ii) to pay compensation for property damage, in case of impossibility of recovering the degraded area, in an amount to be defined in the settlement phase, by arbitration.\r\n\r\nIn view of the sentence, IBAMA filed a motion for clarification requesting that the defendant be ordered to pay the amount of R$ 1,447,650.20 related to the social cost of carbon, on which the sentence did not rule.\r\n\r\nSubsequently, an integrative judgment was issued in which the court remedied the omission of the previous decision by including in the conviction the obligation to pay for the social cost of carbon.",

On the merits, it requests the defendant's conviction in the obligation to do - to recover an area equivalent to that deforested - and the obligation to pay - in the amount related to the social cost of carbon.\r\n\r\nIn a preliminary decision, the court rejected the injunction, considering that there was no urgency of the provision or danger of delay.\r\n\r\nThe defendant filed a defense arguing that the initial complaint showed no evidence relating the facts to the alleged environmental damage. He affirmed the insignificance of the deforestation caused, which, in his words, only had occurred to ensure the survival of his family. Silmar Gomes also stated the irrelevant extension of the area deforested when compared to the total area preserved. On the merits, he questioned the infraction notice that supports the complaint, stating that it would be fairer to apply a milder penalty of recomposition of the vegetation cover. He claimed that the infraction notice issued by IBAMA would be illegal and that the right to an adversarial proceeding and a broad defense would have been violated; in addition to abuse of the inspectors involved. It claimed the absence of the elements necessary to characterize strict liability, alleging the absence of specific and consequential environmental damage (to fauna, flora, soil erosion and global warming). Finally, it asserted that the preliminary injunctions and the reversal of the burden of proof were not appropriate.\r\n\r\nThe plaintiff,  IBAMA, submitted a reply challenging the points raised by the opposition, and attached Technical Information No. 10/2019-COREC/CGBIO/DBFLO, which explains how the calculation is made to arrive at the amount of compensation sought in relation to the application of the Social Cost of Carbon (CSC).\r\n\r\nA judgment was issued partially upholding the claims. The defendant's arguments were refuted and it was stated that the notice of violation was covered by the requirements of validity. It was held that both the environmental damage and the causal link necessary for liability were demonstrated in the document. Thus, it condemned the defendant in the obligation to establish the recovery in natura, and must elaborate and fulfill a reforestation project of the deforested area, under penalty of a fine. It was also determined the unavailability of the defendant's assets to ensure compliance with the sentence, and the suspension of credit, incentives and tax benefits granted by the Public Power, until the full repair of the damage is proven. However, the request regarding the obligation to pay for climate damage was not accepted. The court held that the payment based on the CSC was not a feasible obligation, stating that there was no delimitation due to lack of expert evidence.\r\n\r\nSubsequently, IBAMA filed an appeal, reiterating the argument of the need for compensation based on the CSC. It asserted that the initial petition indicated and demonstrated the probable amount of GHG emissions that the suppression carried out by the defendant caused, as well as indicated pecuniary values for its due compensation. It stated that the values presented are estimates of reasonable accuracy based on scientific data. The judgment, however, despite having condemned the defendant for the damage and to restore the area, denied the request regarding the payment of climate damage. The appellant also emphasized that, since the damage is certain and proven, it cannot be allowed to go unrepaired, and the sentence should be reformed in this regard. The appealed party, Silmar Gomes, filed counter-appeals defending the maintenance of the sentence and the appeal is still pending.\r\n",

      "summary": "On January 28, 2019, Brazil’s Federal Environment Agency (“IBAMA”), filed a public civil action (environmental class-action) against Seringal Indústria e Comércio de Madeiras EIRELI seeking compensation for environmental and climate damages based on an infringement notice for illegal wood storage without an environmental license. \r\n\r\nThis public civil action is part of a set of 9 lawsuits brought by IBAMA on the same grounds, but against different defendants, to question illegal wood deposits and climate damage. \r\n\r\nThe plaintiff alleges that the storage of wood without proven origin is associated with illegal deforestation and predatory exploitation in the Amazon biome. Thus, it seeks reparation for environmental damages provoked by it, including (i) the damage caused to flora and fauna, (ii) soil erosion, (iii) contribution to global warming. \r\n\r\nAs for the climate damage, it claims that the unlawful conduct not only removed carbon sinks from the forest, but also caused the release of carbon into the atmosphere. \r\n\r\nThe plaintiff seeks redress through the determination of (i) an obligation to restore the vegetation in an area equivalent to that estimated by IBAMA, based on the volume of logs seized, amounting to 39.412 hectares, ideally in an area of the same biome in Indigenous Land, Conservation Unit or Agrarian Reform Settlement Project and (ii) an obligation to pay the climate damage based on the Carbon Social Cost (CSC) in the amount of R$ 3,827,228.38. It claims, based on the polluter pays principle, that the climate damage represents an external social cost that is not internalized by the illegal deforestation, leaving it to society. It also argues that climate damage can be quantified on an individual scale by multiplying the estimated GHG emissions of the activity by the CSC. In this case, IBAMA uses the Amazon Fund methodology to estimate emissions based on the area of the Amazon biome considered deforested, summing up to 14,464.204 tons of carbon.\r\n\r\nThe plaintiff requests, as an injunction: (i) suspension of financing and tax incentives and access to credit lines by the offender, (ii) unavailability of assets in the estimated amount for the obligation of the vegetation restorage and the obligation to compensate the climate damage, and (iii) judicial restraint order of the illicit polluting activity. On the merits, it requests the defendant's conviction in the obligation to do - to recover an area equivalent to that deforested - and the obligation to pay - in the amount related to the social cost of carbon.\r\n\r\nIn a preliminary decision, the court rejected the injunction, understanding that there was no urgency in the provision or danger of delay.\r\n\r\nThe defendant filed a response alleging the ineptness of the complaint, arguing that the facts had not been proven, pointing them out as mere unreasonable presumptions. It also claimed that it’s illegitimacy to be a party to the action, since there was no proof of conduct, comissive or omissive, or causal connection that linked itself to the environmental damage. Finally, it requested the termination of the case without resolution of its merits or the judgment for dismissal of the action.\r\n\r\nOn August 15, 2023, there was a decision granting the plaintiffs' requests and ordering Seringal Industria e Comércio de Madeiras EIRELI (i) to recover the degraded area described of 39.412 hectares, (ii) in the alternative, if it is impossible to recover the area at issue, to pay compensation of R$423,363.70 and (iii) to pay compensation corresponding to the social cost of carbon (SCC) of R$3,827,228.38. On August 28, 2023, the defendant company filed an appeal alleging a lack of evidence since the causal link to the damage is presumed without mentioning the date of the deforestation, which was verified using remote systems without on-site inspection.

Thus, it granted and ordered (i) the suspension of the right to participate in financing lines offered by official credit establishments and (ii) the restriction of access to tax incentives and tax benefits offered by the Government in the three spheres of the Federation. However, the Federal Judge stated that, for the time being, the use of the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) for the purposes of decreeing the unavailability of assets was not feasible due to the lack of technical subsidies, and that the amount requested was, at first glance, disproportionate.\r\n\r\nIBAMA then filed an interlocutory appeal (AI 1004508-40.2019.4.01.0000) requesting the inclusion of the amount related to the CSC in the declaration of unavailability of assets, considering the soundness of the methodology used as a reference for its quantification. It argues that in order to fully recover the environmental damage caused, it is necessary to include the social cost of carbon, which appears as \"residual damage\" or \"permanent damage\".\r\n\r\nA first conciliation hearing was held in which the parties expressed interest in formalizing an agreement, although they did not have a proposal ready.\r\n\r\nIn response, the defendant alleged a violation of the principle of due process of law in the administrative proceeding to determine the environmental violation and the absence of a causal link for imputation of liability. In addition, it argued that the use of the social cost of carbon for the purpose of quantifying the damage implies unjust enrichment since the extraction of forest products is a conduct unrelated to its business activity.\r\n\r\nA new hearing was held with the presentation of a settlement proposal by the defendant. IBAMA disagreed with the settlement offer because it only contemplated the obligation to indemnify the environmental damage, with no mention of the need to restore the degraded area, and requested the proposal to be complemented. Thus, the defendant submitted a new proposal that is under analysis by IBAMA.\r\n\r\nThe defendant did not appear at the hearing and the court ruled that the attempt at self-composition had failed. At the time, IBAMA claimed that there was no possibility of an agreement since there had already been an administrative procedure, and this hypothesis was rejected.",

It also claimed that the environmental agents had gotten the quantity of timber stored wrong and , therefore, that the defendant did not have illegal wood deposit. It also questioned the methodology used by IBAMA to calculate the environmental damage based on the Social Cost of Carbon, stating that there was no possibility of really individualizing the alleged damage. Finally, it requested the dismissal of the case without resolution on the merits or the judgment on merits rejecting the complaint.\r\nIBAMA filed a reply challenging the points raised in the opposition, and attached Technical Information No. 10/2019-COREC/CGBIO/DBFLO, which explains how the calculation is made to arrive at the amount of compensation sought regarding the application of the Social Cost of Carbon (CSC). \r\nThe court ruled the claim in advance, partially accepting the initial petition requests. The Federal Judge understood that the materiality and authorship of the environmental offense had been proven by the work of IBAMA agents - inspection report and photographic report presented. It considered that the defendant's conduct caused damage to the community, including loss of soil nutrients, effects on the local population, loss of natural capital, increase of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and decrease of water availability, accepting the request for condemnation to pay for the social cost of carbon. He argued that the amount to be paid should be fixed based on the severity of the damage, the degree of guilt of the offender and the socioeconomic size of the defendant. Thus, he understood that the damage in question is relevant and that the defendant has a high degree of guilt. He ordered the defendant to recompose 96 hectares through the preparation of a reforestation plan, according to the conditions established by the court; to pay the amount of R$1,000,000.00  on the basis of the social cost of carbon, by depositing it in a judicial account; and to the loss or suspension of the defendant's participation in financing lines offered to official credit establishments and the loss or restriction of access to incentives and tax benefits offered by the Government.\r\nThe defendant submitted an appeal in the execution phase of the proceedings, alleging the unenforceability of the order, requesting the annulment of the decision that converted the obligation to do into losses and damages.",

      "summary": "In a decision of September 30, 2020, the Constitutional Court held that climate-damaging tax benefits for aviation companies cannot be contested by persons who do not use the services of these companies for environmental reasons. The corresponding application thus was inadmissible (see http://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/greenpeace-v-austria/). On February 23, 2022, a previously uninvolved applicant – a consumer using both rail and air services – resubmitted the application. The applicant has been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis and suffers from the related Uthoff syndrome – symptoms associated with multiple sclerosis exacerbate in case of higher temperatures. At temperatures of 25°C, the applicant’s ability to walk is limited; at temperatures of 30°C, the applicant depends on a wheelchair and assistance from others. As a result of climate change, the number of warm and hot days in Austria steadily increased; the average temperature in Austria has already risen by 1.8°C (compared to the global average of 1°C). Thus, Austria is particularly affected by the climate crisis. Nevertheless, it further aggravates the climate crisis: Austrian tax law provides that the domestic part of cross-border passenger transportation by aviation companies is exempt from the turnover tax. Furthermore, paraffin – the fuel for air travel – is exempt from the mineral oil tax. On the other hand, passenger transportation by rail companies is not exempt from the turnover tax even though greenhouse gas emissions associated with a rail journey are, on average, 31 times lower than when traveling the same distance by airplane. \r\n\r\nAgainst this background, the applicant alleged the unconstitutionality of relevant tax provisions in the Federal Turnover Tax Act and the Mineral Oil Tax Act for violating her fundamental rights. In concrete terms, the applicant alleged a violation of her right to equality before the law, her right to life and her right to private and family life. \r\nThe right to equality before the law conveys a right to equal treatment – differentiations are only justified when they result from differences in facts. According to the applicant, trains and airplanes are – at least in Europe and Austria, where the high-speed rail network is well developed – equivalent means of transport as total travel time is similar. Differences only occur with regard to associated emissions which are drastically higher when traveling per plane. Tax benefits for aviation thus lead to unequal treatment of equivalent means of transport that stand in direct competition. As a result of tax benefits for aviation, end consumers that travel by rail have to pay 10% more for their tickets for an identical route at an identical price per kilometer than if they were to fly. This unequal treatment is not objectively justified. It contradicts Austria’s obligations under international and European law to mitigate the climate crisis, increasing greenhouse gas emissions and promoting climate-damaging behavior. Therefore, the applicant asserted a violation of her right to equality before the law. \r\n\r\nThe applicant further alleged a violation of her right to life. The right to life, as enshrined in Art 2 ECHR and Art 2 CFR, entails positive obligations – the state must adopt measures that prevent (foreseeable) threats to life. Climate change threatens human life directly and indirectly, for example, by destroying ecosystems. The Austrian state, thus, is under a positive obligation to adopt measures to prevent threats to life from climate change. However, the state not only disregards this obligation but also encourages climate-damaging behavior by granting tax benefits to aviation. Due to the lack of justification, the applicant asserts a violation of her right to life. \r\nPositive obligations also arise from the right to respect for private and family life according to Art 8 ECHR and Art 7 CFR. The Austrian state is obliged to protect health, physical and mental well-being and bodily integrity from environmental hazards, including climate change. Climate change leads to an increased occurrence of extreme weather events such as heat waves, floods or hurricanes, which negatively impact human health. This is particularly evident in the case of the applicant who, due to the increasing number of warm and hot days caused by climate change, is more frequently dependent on a wheelchair and assistance or forced to live isolated in cooled indoor areas. The applicant thus alleged that the Austrian state violates its positive obligations under Art 8 ECHR and Art 7 CFR by promoting climate damaging behavior through tax benefits.\r\n\r\nThe applicants demanded that the Constitutional Court repeals the relevant provisions of the Federal Turnover Tax Act and the Mineral Oil Tax Act as unconstitutional. In addition, she asked the Constitutional Court to initiate preliminary ruling proceedings at the European Court of Justice to clarify whether Art 37 CFR constitutes a fundamental right, a principle or a European objective.   \r\n\r\nOn June 27, 2023, the Constitutional Court dismissed the application as inadmissible. As of January 1, 2023, the Turnover Tax Act had been amended to exempt not only aviation but also cross-border rail transport from the turnover tax. The applicants lacked standing since the originally contested provision was no longer in force. The court further held that the obligation to pay turnover taxes was directed at businesses and that consumers were, therefore, excluded from challenging respective provisions. The same applies in connection with the mineral oil tax: since it is not payable by consumers, they are not affected in their legal sphere and thus are not entitled to challenge tax provisions. ",

      "summary": "In 2023, the applicant filed a complaint with the Austrian Constitutional Court and alleged that Art 3 of the Federal Climate Protection Act (Klimaschutzgesetz) was unconstitutional for not ensuring Austria’s compliance with international and European greenhouse gas reduction obligations, thereby violating fundamental rights. \r\nThe Federal Climate Protection Act was adopted in 2011 to implement emission reduction obligations under international and European Law. According to Art 3 para 1 of the Act, the maximum permissible GHG emissions shall be defined in the annexes to the Act and distributed among sectors. The annexes accordingly provide for maximum GHG emissions for 2008-2012 and 2013-2020; the Act does not stipulate any emission reduction targets after 2020. In addition, Art 3 para 2 Federal Climate Protection Act provides a (mere) negotiation obligation regarding measures that ensure compliance with maximum GHG emissions. Also, the Act does not contain a sanction mechanism. \r\n\r\nThe applicant brought forward that Art 3 Federal Climate Protection Act leads to a shifting of the GHG reduction burden to the future and hinders compliance with international and European emission reduction obligations until 2030. To comply with international and European GHG reduction obligations, Austria would have to adopt drastic measures in the near future. These measures would infringe on fundamental rights as many areas of life and personal freedom are inextricably linked to the emission of greenhouse gases. The applicant accordingly asserted a violation of the right to property, the freedom of occupation, and the right to respect for private and family life. In addition, the applicant suggested that the challenged provision was disproportionate for not ensuring compliance with international and European law and, therefore, infringed on the right to equality before the law. \r\n\r\nOn June 27, 2023, the Constitutional Court rejected the application. The Court held that it was not evident from the application which of the future measures mentioned by the applicant would interfere with which fundamental rights positions. Contrary to procedural provisions, the alleged unconstitutionality was not explained in detail. Hence, the application was inadmissible. ",

      "summary": "On August 9, 2023, Australian Parents for Climate Action (AP4CA) filed a claim in the Federal Court of Australia challenging allegedly misleading statements made by EnergyAustralia about its “carbon neutral” energy products. AP4CA is a climate advocacy organization that works for parents, carers, and families who want to create a safer future for their children. EnergyAustralia produces and sells electricity and is Australia’s third largest domestic greenhouse gas emitter, producing 16.2 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent in 2021/22. EnergyAustralia offers “Go Neutral Electricity” and “Go Neutral Gas” products. “Go Neutral” customers purchase energy which is mainly sourced from burning fossil fuels, and EnergyAustralia promises to purchase carbon credits to “offset” the associated emissions. The “Go Neutral” products require consumers to opt-in, but there is no additional cost to the consumer. \r\n\r\nEnergyAustralia, on its website, claims that: \r\n\r\n1.\t“Go Neutral” electricity and gas is “carbon neutral”;\r\n2.\tEmissions created by “Go Neutral” electricity and gas are “cancelled out” or “negated”; \r\n3.\tBy opting into “Go Neutral” products, consumers “have a positive impact on the environment”. \r\n\r\nAP4CA argues that EnergyAustralia’s marketing of its “Go Neutral” products amounts to misleading or deceptive conduct contrary to section 18 of the Australian Consumer Law. AP4CA argues that carbon offsets do not “cancel out” or “neutralize” the emissions generation by “Go Neutral” energy and that using “Go Neutral” energy does not have a positive impact on the environment. This is because, in summary: \r\n\r\n1.\tPaying someone else to avoid generating emissions (known as an “avoidance” credit) is not equivalent to removing the emissions generated from “Go Neutral” energy. Almost 99% of EnergyAustralia’s carbon credits are avoidance credits;\r\n2.\tPaying someone else to remove carbon emissions from the atmosphere (known as a “removal” credit) does not cancel out or negate the emissions generated from “Go Neutral” energy. The carbon removal projects EnergyAustralia buys are short-lived and not permanent; \r\n3.\tThe emissions from “Go Neutral” ultimately result in a net increase in greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. \r\n\r\nAP4CA also argues that EnergyAustralia’s renewable energy product “PureEnergy” was not given the same prominence on its website as “Go Neutral”, meaning customers could not compare both products. AP4CA seeks a declaration that EnergyAustralia has misled its customers since 2019 about the greenhouse gas emissions associated with their electricity and gas usage. AP4CA also seeks an order that EnergyAustralia be restrained from making “carbon neutral” or similar statements to describe the “Go Neutral” product and that it issue a corrective statement to its customers. \r\n\r\nThe Court will list the matter for a first case management hearing. \r\n\r\nOn 15 May 2025, the parties reached a settlement as the final hearing was about to commence. Under the settlement terms, EnergyAustralia issued a formal statement acknowledging that carbon offsets do not negate the environmental harm caused by greenhouse gas emissions. EnergyAustralia issued an apology to the 400,000 customers who were part of the ‘Go Neutral’ product scheme, removed all marketing relating to the product on its websites, and discontinued the ‘Go Neutral’ products.

      "summary": "In South Korea, four constitutional complaints have been filed challenging the constitutionality of the Framework Act on Carbon Neutrality and Green Growth for Coping with Climate Crisis (“Carbon Neutrality Act”). These complaints claimed that the Nationally Determined Contributions (“NDCs”) set by Article 8(1) of the Carbon Neutrality Act and Article 3(1) of its Enforcement Decree is insufficient to achieve the Paris Agreement climate goals and therefore fails to provide necessary protection of the plaintiffs’ constitutional rights. The National Human Rights Commission (“NHRC”), the independent body of the Korean Government on human rights matters, in consideration of the significance of these cases, decided to submit an opinion to the Constitutional Court on the human rights impact of climate change and on the issue of unconstitutionality of the disputed clauses.\r\n\r\nThe NHRC submitted the following opinion to the Constitutional Court:\r\n\r\n\"Article 8(1) of the Carbon Neutrality Act and Article 3(1) of the Enforcement Decree of the Carbon Neutrality Act are unconstitutional because they violate the state's duty to protect fundamental rights, the principle of non-blanket delegation, the principle of parliamentary reservation, and the principle of equality by failing to implement minimum protection measures for the freedoms and rights of current and future generations that are violated by the effects of climate change.\"\r\n\r\nThe NHRC opined that legal prerequisites of constitutional complaints - the possibility of violation and present, own, and direct concern - were met.\r\n\r\nSouth Korea's carbon budget is expected to be exhausted before 2030, forcing future generations to reduce their GHG emissions drastically. Climate change affects freedom in all aspects of human life, a fundamental right that present and future generations must share. Shifting the burden unequally to future generations is discriminatory treatment without a rational basis and violates the constitutional principle of equality.\r\n\r\nThe Constitution does not explicitly prescribe the state’s obligation to reduce GHG. However, constitutional interpretation can derive a state's obligation to protect and ensure the safety of its citizens from disasters and danger caused by climate change. The law only sets a lower limit of 35% reduction from the 2018 level by 2030, which falls far short of the internationally agreed targets and particularly fails to provide sufficient protection between 2031 and 2050. Therefore, the state has failed to provide minimum measures to protect the petitioners' fundamental rights.\r\n\r\nArticle 8(1) of the Carbon Neutrality Act sets a lower limit of 35% reduction from 2018 level by 2030. Article 3(1) of its Enforcement Decree sets a reduction target of 40% from 2018 level by 2030, and both targets fall short of the global reduction pathway presented by the IPCC. This means that the law does not provide any meaningful standard for establishing an effective NDC. Further, the law not only fails to provide any guidance on how the reduction pathway should be drawn up to 2030, but also is completely silent on the reduction plan from 2031 to 2050. Thus, the law violated the principle of non-blanket delegation and the principle of parliamentary reservation.",

Together with a precautionary measure, the plaintiffs asked the judge to order the Province to elaborate an integral and participative Plan to protect the river basin’s aquatic fauna and fish resources. Although the claim made only a passing reference to climate change to highlight the increasing pressure that the aquatic fauna is suffering and will suffer due to climatic changes, the Public Prosecutor introduced a climate focus to the case. On May 31, 2021, the Public Prosecution Office intervened in the case as a party, supporting the plaintiffs’ stance and asking for new remedies from the judge. Among other arguments, the Prosecutor observed that the second Argentinean NDC had identified the “extraordinarily low water levels in the rivers” causing problems to “subsistence fishermen…” as a climate risk for the Santa Fe region and referred to the IPCC reports and the Paris Agreement to allege the need for public authorities to implement climate adaptation measures, including the need of livelihood diversification of vulnerable groups. According to the Prosecutor, in this case, this was connected to the effective functioning and implementation of two institutional mechanisms: the Provincial Reconversion Council and the Fishery Reconversion and Fishermen's Assistance Fund. The Prosecutor observed that these two mechanisms, which were not currently functioning, had been created with aims that ‘certainly constitute climate adaptation measures’ to protect vulnerable groups of fishermen in the region. In this sense, the Prosecutor maintained that their “implementation is an urgent tool for a satisfactory solution to the socio-environmental conflict suffered by the fishermen of Santa Fe and the ecosystem of the Paraná River, not only in terms of the current low water levels, but also those that will continue to occur due to climate change.”\r\n\r\nOn June 22, 2023, the Court decided the case in favor of the plaintiffs and, among other measures, ordered the Province to elaborate an integral, informed, public, and participative “Strategic Plan for the sustainable use of the aquatic resources.” Even though the Court avoided mentioning climate change or climate adaptation in its judgment, it engaged with and sustained the Public Prosecutor’s arguments regarding the need to implement both the Provincial Reconversion Council and the Fishery Reconversion and Fishermen's Assistance Fund in order to allow for the “reconversion, adaptation, and diversification of the fishing activity and its social actors, with the clear objective of cushioning the impact that possible situations of closure or restrictions to the activity resulting from environmental crises could have on their economies.”  The Province of Santa Fe has appealed the judgment.\r\n\r\nOn April 23, 2024, the Court of Appeal upheld the decision of the District Court.

The party claims that the defendants have omitted the task of combating deforestation in the Amazon, failing to comply with the provisions of articles 23, items VI and VII, and 225, caput and §1, items VI and VII, of the Federal Constitution. It presents the growing deforestation of the biome, especially as of 2019, as evidence of the concerns. The political party also points out the delegitimization, by the Executive Branch, of the data presented by the Space Research Institute (INPE) which proves the increase in deforestation, even causing the dismissal of the Institute's head of research and publication, violating the right to transparency. It presents data brought by the non-governmental organization Instituto do Homem e Meio Ambiente da Amazônia (Imazon), that exposed the rampant increase in deforestation that could lead to a \"tipping point\", at which point the cleared forest can not be recovered, seriously impacting climate change in the region. The case also points out the cuts in financial transfers by other states to the Amazon Fund due to the alleged omission of the Executive Branch.\r\n\r\nIn addition, it argues that Brazil is failing to comply with objective 15.2 of the United Nations (UN) 2030 Agenda, which refers to combating deforestation by 2020. It claims that this commitment was also made at national level by Federal Decree 7.390/2010, revoked by Federal Decree 9.578/2018, which provides for an 80% reduction in annual deforestation rates in the Legal Amazon compared to the years 1996 to 2005, a measure that is part of the National Plan on Climate Change.\r\n \r\nAmong the requests is that: (i) that the injunction be granted, ordering the President of the Republic and the Minister of the Environment to promote concrete actions to combat deforestation in the Amazon; (ii) that the defendants be ordered to report on the measures adopted to combat deforestation, following the release of the data by INPE; (iii) that they be ordered to provide annual data on actions to combat deforestation since 2011; (iv) on the merits, that the injunction be confirmed, and the unconstitutional omission declared in order to order the adoption of administrative measures, in accordance with art. 103, §2, of the Federal Constitution; (v) in the alternative, that the progressive omission be declared unconstitutional in order to warn the defendants of their omission; and (vi) if the Court finds that the ADO is inappropriate, that this action be received and processed as an Argument for Failure to Comply with a Fundamental Precept (ADPF) due to the fungibility of actions.\r\n\r\nDue to the similarity of the objects of this ADO (54) and ADPF 760, the Rapporteur of both, Minister Carmen Lúcia, decided to judge them together. In a plenary session, the Justice acknowledged and upheld the actions. In her vote, the Justice stated that the right to an ecologically balanced environment is a fundamental right provided for in the Constitution and in international treaties to which Brazil is a party. The Minister emphasized the principle of the prohibition of environmental retrogression and considered that there was a process of normative \"termite infestation\" taking place silently, through the dismantling of the state's bureaucratic-normative apparatus. This phenomenon is only visible with a general analysis of the existing framework in the country. It recognized the unconstitutional state of affairs regarding the illegal deforestation of the Amazon rainforest. It ordered the resumption of the Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of Deforestation in the Legal Amazon (PPCDAm) by the Federal Union and the competent federal bodies. After the Reporting Justice's vote, Justice André Mendonça asked to see the case file and so the judgment was suspended.\r\n\r\n In April 2024, ADPF 760 and ADO 54 were partially upheld. The Court did not declare the state of affairs unconstitutional but recognized the existence of structural flaws in the policy of protecting the Legal Amazon. It ordered the Federal Government to make a \"significant commitment\" to combating illegal deforestation in the biome and determined that it should adopt measures to implement the PPCDAm, strengthen the inspection bodies IBAMA, ICMBio and Funai, that the Federal Government present transparent information on the actions and results of the measures adopted in compliance with the STF's orders and that the data on the measures adopted by the Executive Branch should be submitted to the CNJ's Observatory on the Environment and Climate Change in the Judicial Branch.

The aim is to resume the federal environmental sanctioning process. The plaintiffs argue that the federal government has acted to dismantle and weaken the national environmental protection system. They highlight the increase in deforestation and fires in the Amazon and the Pantanal, also affecting indigenous lands, as well as the paralysis of the Action Plan for the Prevention and Control of Deforestation in the Legal Amazon (PPCDAm) and the delegitimization of data relating to these facts by the President of the Republic. They argue that the issuance of Federal Decree 9.760/2019 by the President of the Republic paralyzed the environmental sanctioning process, mainly due to the provision of the conciliation stage in the process and the impossibility of converting fines into environmental services. They point out that the conversion provided for in Federal Law 9.605/1998, which provides for criminal and administrative sanctions for conduct harmful to the environment, is an important institute for fulfilling Brazil's commitment to the Paris Agreement (enacted by Federal Decree 9.073/2017). They allege that the cases awaiting conciliation hearings have been suspended, while the statute of limitations continues to run. The plaintiffs argue that the Federal Government could not have amended Federal Law 9.605/1998, introducing a new phase to the sanctioning process, by means of a decree, in addition to the fact that the normative instrument has several inconsistencies. They argue that paralyzing this system violates articles 225, 231 and 23, caput and items VI and VII, of the Federal Constitution, the principles related to due process of law and the precautionary principle. They request, as a precautionary measure: (i) the declaration of unconstitutionality of Federal Decree 9. 760/2019 and that the environmental sanctioning process be unblocked; (ii) alternatively, that the aforementioned decree be interpreted in accordance with the Constitution, in the terms requested; (iii) if it is understood in a different way to the previous requests, that the counting of the statute of limitations for the processes be suspended until the conciliation hearing takes place; (iv) that the implementation of the requested measures be monitored; (v) that the Federal Government be ordered to submit to the Court a plan for resuming the regular functioning of the environmental sanctioning process; and (vi) for the Federal Government to refrain from taking any further measures that hinder, make unfeasible or paralyze the regular progress of the federal environmental sanctioning process. In the final analysis, they request confirmation of the precautionary measures, with the declaration of unconstitutionality of the Federal Decree in question.\r\n\r\nReporting Justice Rosa Weber admitted the Brazilian Association of Members of the Public Prosecutor's Office for the Environment (ABRAMPA) and the Climate Observatory Laboratory (Observatório do Clima) as amici curiae. In its statement, ABRAMPA highlighted the climate issue and reinforced the points made in the initial petition. It pointed out that the increase in deforestation causes socio-environmental damage and that the land use change and forestry sector is the largest source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in Brazil. He pointed out that encouraging the advance of illegal deforestation aggravates global warming, contrary to international climate commitments and Brazilian climate policy. It therefore argued that the situation violates the fundamental right to an ecologically balanced environment and climate stability. Finally, he emphasized the need for the precautionary measures to be assessed and for a judgment to be made upholding the initial requests.\r\n\r\nThe case was redistributed to Justice Luiz Fux. Luiz Fux. In his decision rendered on December 15, 2023, he ruled that the ADPF had lost its object, considering the substantial change in the factual-normative framework that existed at the time the suit was filed, including the express repeal of the provisions that brought about the innovations being challenged. For these reasons, he dismissed the case without a decision on the merits.\r\n\r\nIn February 2024, the decision became final and the case was dismissed.",

An Initial Rapid Assessment (IRA) by the Ministry of Home Affairs showed that the disaster claimed 141 lives, injured 117 persons, displaced over 460,900 people, and left 24 missing. Damage to houses, infrastructure, and productive resources was severe with 65,000 houses destroyed and over 120,100 partially damaged.\r\n\r\nAmarnath Jha, the plaintiff in this case, was from Saptari, the region that was perhaps worst affected by the floods. Days of unrelenting rainfall there led rivers to burst across their banks, inundating houses and blocking critical medical care for inhabitants. Jha, in his initial appeal argued that flooding and the subsequent inefficiency by the Government of Nepal to coordinate humanitarian aid and build appropriate embankments resulted in inhabitants having to drink unsafe rainwater and starve. \r\n\r\nThe Court, taking note of this, issued an interim order which held that Article 16 of the Constitution which guarantees the right to live with dignity, Article 35 which ensures the right to basic health and emergency health services, and Article 36 as well as 37 which guarantees the right to food and shelter had been violated as a result of the government’s failure to initiate flood mapping and mitigation measures. \r\n\r\nMoreover, the subsequent full judgement particularly took note of how climate change will impact rainfall, snowmelt, and Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOCFs) in the Himalayas leading to increased risk of flooding in urban and rural areas. As such, the judgement recalled the Government’s obligation under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change of 1992 to address the impacts of climate change on water resources and agriculture, to create a comprehensive and integrated plan for the protection and rehabilitation of areas particularly affected by drought and floods. It also referenced Article 8 of the Paris Agreement, to which Nepal is party, which underscores the importance of emergency preparedness, early warning systems, and comprehensive risk assessment. In keeping with this, it also urged the Government to comply with the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction and the Yokohama Guidelines for Natural Disaster Prevention that outlines the sovereign responsibility of each state to protect its citizens from natural disasters. \r\n\r\nFurther, in recognizing this to be the first case of its kind and cognizant of how these disputes will likely become more common in the future, the judgement held that pursuant to Section 26 and 28 of the Environmental Protection Act, 2019 all three levels of the federal government are to be held responsible for developing policies, strategies, and action plans to reduce the adverse effects and risks caused by climate change. Finally, it emphasized the increasing interconnectedness between environment, climate change and human rights law and how the Court must exercise its authority to protect public interest and environmental justice.\r\n\r\nIn the final judgment the bench issued an order of mandamus to ensure not just immediate relief packages but also long term rehabilitation to the victims; and, to reduce the damage caused by flooding of the Khado River by constructing dams and embankments in places where there is risk of flood.",

      "count": 1,
      "summary": "In December 2022, twelve (12) members of the Indigenous community “Gran Cumbal” in Nariño, Colombia, learned of the existence of a contract between the Indigenous community’s authority and SVP Business SAS to purchase carbon credits related to the REDD+ project “Pachamama Cumbal”. Plaintiffs assert the contract was negotiated without their knowledge, despite the fact that it would impact Indigenous territory. They argue that the Indigenous authority overreached their functions and that no information was shared with the community. In June 2023, plaintiffs filed a tutela alleging that the private companies involved in the carbon credits contract and the associated REDD+ project failed to obtain their consent and violated their fundamental rights to free, prior and informed consultation, active and effective participation in decision making, territory as collective property, self-determination and environmental justice from an Indigenous perspective. \r\n\r\nOn July 21, 2023, the Juzgado Promiscuo Municipal de Cumbal, Nariño (trial level) found that the defendants had violated the plaintiffs’ rights by failing to conduct the free, prior and informed consultation process with the entire community with regard to the carbon credits contract associated to the REDD+ project Pachamama Cumbal. The judge granted a temporary injunction against the REDD+ project and the carbon credit contract and ordered the defendants to conduct a free, prior and informed consultation process within the next six months, in accordance with the ILO Indigenous and Tribal Peoples Convention 169. \r\n\r\nThe judge explicitly mentioned the benefits that REDD+ projects bring to climate action, particularly due to its prevention focus. The decision highlights the fact that these projects act as an incentive to forest protection and aid toward reducing greenhouse gas emissions. However, the lack of meaningful participation from the Indigenous community during the previous phases of the contract violated the plaintiffs` fundamental rights. More importantly, the judge underscored the blatant lack of information regarding the allocation of financial resources resulting from the purchase of carbon credits and asserted the Indigenous communities’ right to that information. Hence, the judge ordered defendants to hold a public hearing where they provide the Indigenous community with a detailed and clear financial report regarding resources from the REDD+ project and the purchase of carbon credits. \r\n\r\nDefendants appealed this decision and on August 23, 2023, the Juzgado Tercero Penal del Circuito de Ipiales, Nariño (appellate level) upheld the lower court’s decision. The appellate judge gave defendants two months to file the request for free, prior and informed consultation before the corresponding authority (Ministry of Interior). The Ministry then has six months to issue a decision on the matter. ",

      "type": "case",
      "count": 1,
      "summary": "Mr. Teitiota came to New Zealand from Kiribati in 2007 and remained after his permit expired in 2010. After being apprehended following a traffic stop, Mr. Teitiota applied for refugee status under s 129 of the Immigration Act 2009 and/or protected person status under s 131. The basis for Mr. Teitiota’s application was that his homeland, Kiribati, is facing steadily rising sea water levels as a result of climate change, and that over time, the rising sea water levels and associated environmental degradation will force the inhabitants of Kiribati to leave their islands.\r\n\r\nA Refugee and Protection Officer declined Mr. Teitiota’s application. Mr. Teitiota then appealed against the Officer’s decision to the Immigration and Protection Tribunal. While the Tribunal accepted that Mr. Teitiota’s concerns about Kiribati and its future were justified, it dismissed his appeal, holding that he was neither a refugee within the meaning of the Refugee Convention nor a protected person within the meaning of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (“ICCPR”). \r\n\r\nThe Tribunal found that the Appellant could not be recognized as a refugee under Article 1(A)(2) of the Refugee Convention. The Tribunal found that there was no evidence that the appellant’s life would be in jeopardy due to the environmental conditions in Kiribati, or that he would be subject to any particular interpersonal threats due to disputes over land. The effects of environmental degradation were faced by the population generally, not by members of particular groups, as required by the Refugee Convention definition ([75]). \r\n\r\nThe Tribunal also found that the appellant was not a protected person under the ICCPR. The appellant failed to establish that there was a sufficient degree of risk to his life or that of his family at the time of the decision. Since the Kiribati government is active in international negotiations about climate change, and is cognizant of and trying to ameliorate the threats posed to its population, there is no indication the appellant will be “arbitrarily deprived” of his right to life pursuant to Article 6 of the ICCPR ([88]). \r\n\r\nMr. Teitiota then sought leave from the High Court to appeal against the Tribunal’s decision on a question of law, identifying six possible questions of law. The High Court declined the application, holding that none of the six questions raised an arguable question of law of general or public importance. The High Court did note that, as correctly recognized by the Tribunal, there is a complex inter-relationship between natural disasters, environmental degradation and human vulnerability, and that “sometimes a tenable pathway to international protection under the Refugee Convention can result” ([27]). \r\n\r\nMr. Teitiota sought leave from the Court of Appeal to appeal to the High Court. That application was also refused, with the Court of Appeal finding that none of the six questions were sufficient to justify the grant of leave. The Court of Appeal did note that “no-one should read this judgment as downplaying the importance of climate change. It is a major and growing concern for the international community. The point this judgment makes is that climate change and its effect on countries like Kiribati is not appropriately addressed under the Refugee Convention” ([41]). \r\n\r\nSubsequently, Mr. Teitiota sought leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of New Zealand against the Court of Appeal’s decision. The Supreme Court agreed with the lower courts, finding that in the particular factual context of this case, the questions identified did not raise an arguable question of law of general or public importance ([12]). The Supreme Court did note that both the Tribunal and High Court had emphasised that their decisions did not mean that environmental degradation resulting from climate change or other natural disasters could never create a pathway into the Refugee Convention or protected person jurisdiction, and that the Supreme Court’s decision “should not be taken as ruling out that possibility in an appropriate case” ([13]). \r\n\r\nNote: Refer also to the United Nations Human Rights Committee Views adopted on Teitiota Communication (https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/un-human-rights-committee-views-adopted-on-teitiota-communication/).",

      "type": "case",
      "count": 1,
      "summary": "This is a Popular Action with a request for an injunction filed by two individuals against an act carried out by the President of the Republic, the President of the CNPE (National Energy Policy Council) - the occupation of the Minister of State for Mines and Energy - and the Federal Union. The action seeks the annulment of an act that determined the reduction of the mandatory blending of biodiesel in diesel oil to 10% during 2022 (\"B10\"), under the terms of CNPE Resolution 25/2021, approved by Order of the President of the Republic. \r\n\r\nThe plaintiffs request that CNPE Resolution 16/2018 be observed, so that the mandatory blend of biodiesel in diesel is 13% (\"B13\") in January and February 2022 and 14% (\"B14\") from March 2022, in keeping with the gradual increase in the blend previously announced by the authorities. They point out that the addition of biodiesel to fossil diesel helps to reduce the harmful environmental impacts caused by the latter and reduces dependence on oil to make diesel. As a clean energy source, biodiesel production has become even more valued, especially considering the commitments made under the Paris Agreement (enacted by Federal Decree 9.073/2017) and the establishment of the National Biofuels Policy - RenovaBio (Federal Law 13.576/2017), which recognizes the strategic role of biofuels in the Brazilian energy matrix for energy security, market predictability and the mitigation of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. \r\n\r\nWith this in mind, the CNPE, through resolutions, and the National Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels Agency (ANP) published the percentage evolution of the biodiesel content to be obligatorily present in fossil diesel, with CNPE Resolution 16/2018 providing for a mandatory percentage of 13% in March 2021 14% in March 2022 and reaching 15% in March 2023. Nevertheless, in 2021, the President of the Republic and the President of CNPE established a temporary measure to reduce the mandatory percentage to 10% for the other auctions to be held in the year, with a view to reducing the price of diesel sold to end consumers. However, by means of CNPE Resolution 25/2021 and an order formalized in December 2021, the President of CNPE and the President of the Republic maintained the mandatory minimum percentage of 10% biodiesel in diesel for the whole of 2022, contrary to the previous CNPE resolution (16/2018). \r\n\r\nIn light of these facts, the plaintiffs claim that this reduction during 2022 is harmful to the environment, administrative morality and public assets, as well as being unconstitutional and illegal. They claim that the act was not duly justified and that the Federal Government deliberately omitted the 8th Extraordinary Meeting of the CNPE, which resulted in the change in the contested percentage. The plaintiffs allege that the percentage reduction in the blend violates the legal order of environmental protection established at the constitutional, legal and international levels, including the Federal Constitution, the RenovaBio Law, the National Policy on Climate Change - PNMC (Federal Law 12.187/2009), the Paris Agreement and the nationally determined contributions (NDCs) and climate targets presented by Brazil. They maintain that there is damage to administrative morality to the extent that (i) the Public Administration goes against its own rules and manifestations,(ii) there is damage to the biodiesel production chain, and (iii) there is non-compliance with the objective and principle of promoting predictability established by RenovaBio. \r\n\r\nFinally, the plaintiffs claim that the contested act harms public assets by reducing the demand for biodiesel to be produced by the national industry. They request, as a preliminary injunction: (i) the suspension of the harmful act and, consequently, the determination of compliance with CNPE Resolution 16/2018; and (ii) in the alternative, as long as there is no publication of the conclusive technical note of the study group created to evaluate the mixture of biodiesel in diesel, the suspension of the harmful act and determination of compliance with CNPE Resolution 16/2018. \r\n\r\nOn a final basis, they request: (i) the ratification of the injunction; (ii) the annulment of the harmful act; and (iii) the determination of compliance with CNPE Resolution 16/2018, complying with the \"B13\" percentage in January and February 2022, and \"B14\" from March 2022. \r\n\r\nThe defendants preliminarily argued that the contested act was not harmful or illegal, since Federal Law 13.033/2014 gives the CNPE the power to reduce the percentage of biodiesel blended into diesel sold to final consumers to up to 6% at any time, and that the reduction was based on the public interest. They challenged the value of the case, as they claimed it was exorbitant and without technical basis. On the merits, they emphasized the possibility of reducing the percentage of the mixture due to the legislation in force and the technical-administrative discretion of the Public Administration, which acted based on the CNPE's notes, highlighting its importance as a body made up of various actors and sectors of society. They argued that the reduction in the percentage of biodiesel was justified from a technical point of view and in line with the public interest. They also argued that the evaluation, formulation and implementation of public policies are the typical responsibility of the Executive Branch, and that the Judiciary cannot\r\nintervene. In addition, they emphasized that the agents making investments in the biodiesel sector are aware of the possibility of altering the indicative percentages established by the CNPE in order to protect the consumer. In the end, they argued, among other things: (i) for the initial petition to be rejected or for the case to be dismissed without a decision on the merits; (ii) for the challenge to the value of the cause to be upheld; (iii) for the request for urgent  relief to be rejected; and (iv) for the plaintiff's claims to be dismissed. \r\n\r\nIn its decision on the preliminary injunction, the court did not accept the defendants' preliminary lack of cause of action. With regard to the challenge to the value of the case, it ruled that it should be decided only after the plaintiffs had made their case. It admitted the participation of the National Transportation Confederation (CNT) as amicus curiae. On the merits, it held that the contested act falls within the scope of the technical-administrative discretion of the Public Authority and that it was duly justified in the public interest. Federal Law 13.033/2014 determines that the mandatory minimum percentage is 6% and, as the reduction had been to 10%, it considered that there had been no violation of legality or damage to administrative morality. He also pointed out that the Ministry of the Environment, which sits on the CNPE, had not objected to the proposal to reduce the biodiesel content. He concluded that the Judiciary should not interfere with the Public Administration, under penalty of violating the separation of powers. He therefore dismissed the request for an injunction. \r\n\r\nA judgment was subsequently handed down dismissing the Popular Action. The court reiterated the grounds presented in the preliminary injunction and added that, after this initial rejection, no other evidence was presented that could alter the judgment on the facts alleged in the initial decision. The case was referred to the TRF-4 for analysis, but no judgment has yet been handed down. ",

      "count": 1,
      "summary": "On September 12, 2023, the Federal Environment Agency - IBAMA filed a Public Civil Action (ACP) against Dirceu Kruger for climate damage. The defendant is a cattle raiser and has been fined several times by the environmental agency for illegal deforestation of a total of 5,600 hectares in the state of Amazonas, using fire. It is argued that his illegal activities have an impact on the biomass of the Amazon, illegally interfering with the forest's carbon stock and emitting greenhouse gases (GHG), intensifying the climate crisis. It is argued that climate damage is projected continuously and addresses residual environmental damage in climate matters, which corresponds to the set of effects and imbalances that cannot be remedied. The climate damage also implies intergenerational environmental damage, since it spreads indefinitely, causing future damage. The plaintiff argues that the defendant's conduct was held under violation of the Paris Agreement and that the international obligations internalized by Brazil are binding for the Judicial Branch, implying the determination of reparability of environmental climate damage. It presents a means of quantifying climate damage based on studies by the CADAF Project (Carbon Dynamics of Amazonian Forest), representing 160.34 tons of carbon emitted per deforested hectare; on a study developed by the Center for Management and Strategic Studies: \"REDD in Brazil: an Amazonian approach\", setting 161 tons of carbon per hectare; and on the social cost of carbon (SCC), arguing that there is a direct proportion between the number of hectares deforested and the generation of carbon, in line with the parameters set by the Amazon Fund. Therefore, the plaintiff argues that climate damage can be identified on an individual scale by multiplying the estimated GHG emissions from the activity (5,600 hectares multiplied by 161 tons emitted per hectare) by the SCC (based on the cost calculated by the OECD of 60 euros per ton). Thus, the deforestation generated the illegal emission of 901,600 tons of carbon, resulting in the obligation to pay the amount of R$292,118,400.00. As a preliminary injunction, it is requested that (i) the litigious nature of the property which is the subject of the action be recognized; (ii) the defendant be ordered not to transfer the occupation of the area to third parties; (iii) the defendant be prohibited from leasing or lending chainsaws and other deforestation tools; (iv) the defendant be prohibited from selling or donating oxen or agricultural products; (v) the blocking or unavailability of assets in the equivalent amount of R$292,118,400.00; (vi) the suspension or restriction of the defendant's access to tax benefits and credit lines; (vii) the defendant be ordered to implement carbon sinks. On the merits, the plaintiff claims that the defendant be condemned to (i) repair the environmental climate damage in ecological compensation; (ii) repair the interim climate damage; (iii) promote ecological compensation; (iv) promote financial compensation for illegal greenhouse gas emissions, with the amount of R$292,118,400.00 being reverted to the National Climate Change Fund; (v) promoting financial compensation to be set by the court for the amounts to be reverted to funds for preventing and responding to climate disasters; (vi) compensating the amount related to the disgorgement of profits; and (vii) confirming the requests made as a matter of urgency.\r\n\r\nOn July 12, 2024, a decision on the injunction was handed down in which the court granted, in part, the emergency relief requested to (i) order the defendant's assets to be made unavailable, up to a limit of R$292,118,400.00; (ii) order the defendant to promote the implementation of carbon sinks, considering for this purpose the emission of 901. 600 tonnes of carbon and, for abatement purposes, any recovery/restoration found in the deforested areas, which must be proven when the project is presented within 90 days, under penalty of a daily fine; (iii) suspend and prohibit the defendant's access to lines of financing with official credit institutions; (iv) suspend and prohibit the granting of tax benefits to the defendant; (v) inform national financial institutions of the processing of this lawsuit; (vi) prohibit the defendant from acquiring, selling, leasing or lending chainsaws, tractors and associated instruments, as well as prohibit the defendant from acquiring, selling, leasing or lending cattle or agricultural products, under penalty of a fine for each business act carried out; and (vii) prohibit the defendant from carrying out any business act involving the properties affected by the deforestation discussed in the case, under penalty of a fine for each business act carried out. The secrecy assigned to the decision was lifted. In addition, the initial petition was partially dismissed, and only the claims for the implementation of sinks and the adoption of environmental compensation measures relating to climate damage, for financial compensation for the social cost of carbon, and restitution of illicitly earned profits were processed.",

The plaintiffs reason that these documents could support or prevent the filing of a class action lawsuit. The program provides financing to motor vehicle manufacturers to carry out projects to expand their industrial plants, set up new factories or develop new products. The plaintiffs allege that it is potentially illegal for IncentivAuto to finance projects that do not minimize the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, in disagreement with the State Policy on Climate Change - PEMC (State Law 13.798/2009) and the National Policy on Climate Change - PNMC (Federal Law 12.187/2009). In addition, they argue that the use of resources from the São Paulo State Taxpayers Support Fund (FUNAC) to finance projects that stimulate polluting action is potentially damaging to the treasury and the environment, without taking into account the need to make socio-economic development compatible with protecting the climate system. The applicants stress the vulnerability of children and adolescents to air pollution and the impacts of climate change. They therefore request the production of documentary evidence relating to projects submitted to IncentivAuto.\r\nOn November 16, 2020, the State of São Paulo offered a reply alleging (i) illegitimacy of the applicants to defend diffuse and unavailable interests of third parties, (ii) disconnection of the right that is intended to protect with the objective facts to be proved with the documents and (iii) existence of confidentiality that justifies the limitation of access to information.\r\nOn January 12, 2021, the court granted the request to provide part of the information requested and for the State of São Paulo to show the documents. Afterwards there was a judgment deeming the case extinct.\r\n\r\nOn June 11, 2021, the proceeding was closed. \r\n\r\nThe plaintiffs filed motions for clarification, which were rejected by the court. They also filed an appeal.\r\n\r\nOn December 14, 2023, the Court dismissed the appeal. The lower court held that the IncentivAuto program requires \"benefited\" companies to comply with a series of obligations, including obtaining an environmental license that takes into account the legal standard for pollutant emissions set out in \"Proconve.\" For this reason, he considered that there was no contradiction between the program and climate regulations. As for the request to compel the State of São Paulo to include \"in the IncentivAuto Program conditions for the approval of projects relating to the adoption of measures aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions and adapting to the impacts of climate change\", the court stated that it is not appropriate to impose an obligation to do so on the Government in popular action.

      "type": "case",
      "count": 1,
      "summary": "This is a Public Civil Action (ACP), with a request for preliminary relief, filed by the Federal Public Prosecutor's Office (MPF) against the State of São Paulo, CETESB and IBAMA. It calls for the cancellation of all licenses and authorizations issued by the state agency regarding the authorization for the controlled burning of sugar cane straw in the municipalities covered by the Campinas Judicial Subsection, as well as for the defendants to be prevented from issuing new licenses without the preparation of an Environmental Impact Study and Environmental Impact Report (EIA/RIMA). The aim is for IBAMA to act in a supplementary way to implement and supervise measures to protect the environment, since the state agencies responsible are not acting satisfactorily. The plaintiff alleges that this activity entails various damages, such as to the atmosphere - generating pollution and contributing to global warming - to public health, among others, in addition to the fact that the burning of sugarcane straw is a practice repudiated by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change - UNFCCC (promulgated by Decree 2.652/1998). Finally, the MPF requests that, in the event of an application for a license for this activity, an EIA/RIMA must be carried out as a condition for this, and the analysis must be comprehensive, taking into account, among other factors, the changes in the atmosphere related to the greenhouse effect and global warming.\r\nIn its defense, IBAMA claims, among other things, (i) that it is not a party to the lawsuit since it does not have the authority to carry out such licensing, (ii) that the technical criteria relating to the assessment of impacts are acts of technical discretion and (iii) that environmental licensing is unnecessary for the burning of sugarcane straw. The State of São Paulo, in its opposition, argues that the abrupt stoppage of the sugarcane harvesting system will cause damage to economic and social values that will outweigh the impacts on the environment and human health. It identifies the presence of federal and state legislation authorizing the controlled burning of sugarcane straw and that there is state competence to authorize this practice, without the need to prepare an EIA/RIMA. CETESB, in its defence, argues that authorizations for the controlled burning of sugarcane straw include measures to mitigate the negative impacts of the practice, and that the state agency is competent to issue such authorizations. It also argues that it is not necessary to prepare an EIA/RIMA in order to grant authorization for this activity and that the licensing of a sugar-alcohol enterprise covers all activities related to the end activity, such as the agricultural area planted. Finally, it states that the practice respects national and state climate change policies, since the aim is to mechanize sugarcane harvesting and gradually reduce the practice of burning.\r\nA preliminary injunction was issued, in which part of the injunction was granted, determining, among other measures: (i) that CETESB and the State of São Paulo should not grant environmental licenses and permits for the burning of sugarcane straw without first carrying out an EIA/RIMA in the region referring to the Campinas Judicial Subsection; and (ii) that IBAMA should monitor the requirement for licensing and EIA/RIMA. The court found that it was unreasonable to immediately suspend all sugarcane straw burning activities and ordered that the measures be applied from the next harvest onwards.\r\nSubsequently, the court handed down a sentence in which it ordered CETESB and the state of São Paulo to refrain from granting new licenses and authorizations that do not include specific licensing with EIA/RIMA and take into account the consequences of the activity for the atmosphere, global temperature and others; and IBAMA was ordered to supervise the damage caused by the burning of sugarcane straw.\r\n\r\nThe defendants filed an appeal and in their reasons reiterated the arguments put forward in their defense, requesting that the sentence be reformed and that the initial claims be dismissed. The court unanimously upheld the appeals. The preliminary objections of inadequate legal remedies and the lack of jurisdiction of the Federal Court were rejected. In the decision, it was concluded that the interstate or national dimension of the environmental damage was not established, nor was the omission of CETESB such as to impose IBAMA's competence to supervise the activity, confirming the competence of the state agency. The court highlighted that Resolution 237/1997 of the National Environment Council (CONAMA) did not list the burning of sugarcane straw as an activity subject to environmental licensing, and that the Forest Code and state legislation support the authorization granted by CETESB for the burning of sugarcane straw. It also recognized that the activity is suitable for protecting the environment, since the legislation that regulates it provides for the gradual reduction of the use of fire, and that the sudden suspension of the activity would cause serious economic damage, as well as pointing out that CETESB adopts a specific system for issuing authorization for the activity.\r\nIn October 2022, the case was definitively closed.",

      "type": "case",
      "count": 1,
      "summary": "This is a Public Civil Action, with a request for an injunction, brought by the Public Prosecutor's Office of the State of Goiás (MPGO) against the state of Goiás. It seeks to compel the state to take the necessary measures to improve air quality and, consequently, safeguard the health of the population by implementing a public environmental policy for monitoring and controlling air pollution and climate change. The plaintiff claims that the regional government has failed to comply with public environmental control policies aimed at protecting air quality and the climate. It stresses the state's repeated inertia in combating climate change, controlling air pollution and monitoring vehicle pollution, evidenced by the lack of technical actions, such as implementing a network of air quality monitoring stations, carrying out an inventory of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and mobile sources, as well as implementing Vehicle Inspection and Maintenance Programs.\r\nThe Public Prosecution highlights the omission in the analysis of climate impacts in environmental licensing procedures in the state, claims that, in line with the National Policy on Climate Change - PNMC (Federal Law 12.187/2009), the State Policy on Climate Change - PEMC (State Law 16.497/2009) was instituted, but few public policies have been implemented. It also points out the lack of implementation of instruments to prevent atmospheric pollution and climate change, especially the Atmospheric Emissions Control Plan (PCEA) and the Vehicle Pollution Control Plan (PCPV). It highlights the inadequacy of the PCPV in the state of Goiás.\r\nIt outlines the risks of damage to human health and the environment caused by air pollution and noise pollution. It links air pollution caused by the burning of fossil fuels to the climate crisis. It requests, as an injunction, that the State of Goiás be ordered to adopt measures aimed at implementing Conama Resolutions 01/1993, 02/1993, 418/2009 and 491/2018, Federal Laws 8.723/1993, 9.503/1997 and 12.187/2009, the Paris Agreement (enacted by Federal Decree 9.073/2017) and State Law 16.497/2009. On the merits, it requests that the State of Goiás be ordered, among other measures: (i) to implement public environmental policies to control pollution and combat climate change, by drawing up the PCEA, including a network to monitor air quality throughout the state, from both mobile and stationary sources of gas emissions; (ii) to implement a network to monitor air quality throughout the state;(iii) to update the PCPV; (iv) to draw up, implement and carry out the Vehicle Inspection and Maintenance Program (I/M) and the annual Environmental Vehicle Inspection Program for gas and noise emissions in motor vehicles; (v) to define and publish Administrative Regulations establishing (v.1) activities with significant GHG emissions for the purposes of environmental licensing and the requirement to submit a GHG Emission Inventory, (v.2) Term of Reference (TR) criteria for drawing up the Inventory and (v.3 ) technical criteria and standards for assessing environmental impacts on the micro and macroclimate in environmental licensing procedures in the state, as well as GHG mitigation and compensation instruments; (vi) to prove that all environmental licensing procedures in progress that have an Environmental Impact Study and respective Environmental Impact Report (EIA/RIMA) require an inventory of GHG emissions, as well as the obligation to present an assessment of environmental impacts on the micro and macroclimate in the TRs; and (vii) to draw up a State Inventory of GHG Emissions.\r\nIn response to the request for injunctive relief, the judge granted the preliminary injunction, ordering the immediate implementation of the violated normative provisions, considering that the failure of the government to comply with its legal and constitutional obligations would be enough to prove fumus boni juris, while the danger of damage would be characterized by the risk to collective health. In contrast, the state of Goiás filed an interlocutory appeal with suspensive effect, asking for the injunction to be overturned, indicating, in short, (i) the absolute nullity of the decision, since the federal court would be competent to deal with the case, and (ii) the lack of the necessary requirements for granting urgent relief.\r\nIn addition, the state of Goiás filed an opposition. The state argued that only the Executive Branch can determine the form and condition of implementation of environmental public policies, considering the financial resources available. It argued that the Public Prosecutor uses the judicial process to request the implementation of public policies, which is not the appropriate way and interferes with the principle of separation of Powers. It requested, among other things, a preliminary ruling: (i) a declaration of the court's lack of jurisdiction, since the subject matter of the lawsuit deals with the administrative competence of the Federal Union and the municipalities; (ii) the calling to account of the State Traffic Department (Detran/GO), the Goiás Infrastructure and Transport Agency (Goinfra), the Federal Union and the municipalities of Goiás; (iii) the suspension of the dispute for 365 days so that the parties can begin negotiations to establish objective parameters for the implementation of public policies; and (ii) the creation of a Working Group with professionals with knowledge in the areas subject to regulation. On the merits, among other issues, it requested that the injunction be dismissed and that the plaintiff's claims be declared unfounded. In the alternative, it asked that the limits on the reviewability of administrative acts by the Judiciary, the separation of powers and the federal pact be respected.\r\nIn the context of the interlocutory appeal 5245769-11.2022.8.09.0051, the Court of Justice issued a ruling in which it partially accepted the appeal filed by the state of Goiás. It held that it was not possible for the Court to examine the preliminary thesis of absolute incompetence of the Common State Court, as it had not been examined by the previous court. On the merits, it considered that the requirements for granting the injunction requested by the Public Prosecutor's Office had been met. He stressed that the installation of systems to control noise and air pollution emitted by motor vehicles in the state of Goiás has a normative basis for compliance, and recognized that they had not been effectively implemented, resulting in a violation of the constitutional duty to protect the environment. He stated that the aggravated decision merely ordered the appellant to comply with environmental laws. It held that the state had sufficient time to implement public policies, such as those aimed at monitoring and controlling air pollution and climate change and controlling noise pollution, which constituted an omission. It therefore dismissed the appeal.",

      "summary": "This is a Direct Action of Unconstitutionality brought by the Attorney General of the State of Rio Grande do Sul against Municipal Law 4.968/2019 of Eldorado do Sul, which provides for urban policy and establishes the municipality's Urban and Environmental Development Master Plan. The plaintiff argues that the approval of the Plan by the City Council took place without popular participation during the legislative process, in violation of the constitutional right to participation, which makes it incompatible with the Constitution of the state of Rio Grande do Sul and the Federal Constitution. He argues that the law under discussion reduces environmental protection in the city, which reinforces the need for popular participation in the legislative process, as well as the need for a technical study to analyze its environmental impacts. It requests a preliminary injunction to suspend the validity of the contested law. On a final basis, it requests that Municipal Law 4.968/2019 be declared unconstitutional.\r\nThe Reporting Judge granted the injunction. He considered that the documentary evidence showed the lack of popular consultation. He considered that master plans are related to the population's quality of life, and that public discussion is essential. He pointed out that there had been no Environmental Impact Study or Neighborhood Impact Study, considering the National Environmental Policy - PNMA (Federal Law 6.938/1981) and CONAMA Resolution 237/1997.\r\nThe Association of Residents and Friends of Eldorado Park (AMAPE) requested to be admitted as amicus curiae in the case. AMAPE points out, among other issues, the importance of the climate debate in the case. It emphasized that climate should no longer be a peripheral issue in the lawsuit, since, alongside health protection, it is part of the core of the right to a balanced environment, forming part of the environmental existential minimum. He argued that the legislative plan to set up an industrial center in the area of Parque Eldorado (a district of the municipality), related to the opening of the Guaíba coal mine, goes against the need to expand renewable energy sources in order to preserve the planet's climate. He stressed that coal mining should be stopped in order to protect the climate, the environment and health, as provided for in the Paris Agreement (enacted by Federal Decree 9.073/2017). It also claimed that the indigenous community living near the region had not been consulted about the approved law, as required by Convention 169 of the International Labor Organization (ILO). Subsequently, AMAPE and other organizations' request for amicus curiae status was granted.\r\nThe special body of the Rio Grande do Sul Court of Justice upheld the request to declare Municipal Law 4.968/2022 unconstitutional, on the grounds that the requirements of reasonable community participation in the drafting of the rule and prior environmental studies on its impacts were not met, considering the climate issue when mentioning AMAPE's statement.\r\nSubsequently, the Municipal Law in question was repealed, which is why the claim lost its object. It was therefore definitively dismissed.",

      "type": "case",
      "count": 1,
      "summary": "This is a Public Civil Action (ACP) filed by the Public Prosecutor's Office of the State of Rio de Janeiro (MPRJ) against the Municipality of Niterói, with the aim of requiring the defendant to carry out a Neighborhood Impact Study (EIV) before granting a license for the construction of large residential and commercial buildings, with more than six floors, in the Icaraí neighborhood of Niterói. The plaintiff argues that the neighborhood's urban infrastructure does not support greater population density, and that real estate expansion has harmed the local population's quality of life. It argues that new building licenses are being granted without the requirement of a prior urban planning study, in disagreement with municipal urban policies, especially the Master Plan (Municipal Law 1.157, updated by Municipal Law 2.123) and the City Statute (Federal Law 10.257/01). It states that the expansion of the real estate market must take place in accordance with municipal planning, preserving urban sustainability and environmental protection. In this sense, in anticipation of a preliminary injunction, it requests that the defendant be ordered to first obtain an EIV for all large-scale real estate developments in the Icaraí neighborhood, as a condition for a construction permit. On the merits, among the requests, it asks for confirmation of the injunction and for the defendant to be ordered to pay compensation for the moral and material damage suffered by the community as a result of the omission of the EIV.\r\nIn a preliminary injunction, the court found that there was a risk of irreparable damage or damage that would be difficult to repair. He ordered the defendant to proceed with the licensing of the projects in question with the prior approval of the EIV, under penalty of a fine.\r\n\r\nIn its statement of defense, the Municipality of Niterói argued, preliminarily, that the plaintiff had no interest in acting. It alleged that the claim of the present ACP is absorbed in the object of a previous ACP (2009.002.051167-6). It argued also that it is impossible to control the constitutionality of a municipal law by means of an ACP. It is also stated that the plaintiff's allegations are generic, and that the EIV for the aforementioned projects does not fall within the parameters set by the Municipal Legislature that require this assessment. It argued that the municipality was not liable for moral and material damages. It emphasized the lack of technical evidence capable of proving the plaintiff's allegations. He asked for the injunction to be revoked. It requested, among other things, (i) that the lawsuit be dismissed, due to the lack of interest in acting, the inappropriateness of the chosen course of action and lis pendens, and (iv) that the plaintiff's claim be dismissed.\r\n\r\nIn its ruling, the judge held that the City Statute introduced various instruments that allow the state to take preventive measures in order to avoid unbalanced urban growth and guarantee minimum conditions for the occupation of habitable spaces, such as the EIV. It stated that it was an instrument for implementing the principles of prevention, precaution and sustainable development. It also considered that the criterion used by the MPRJ to require the EIV is based on the law, which considers developments with more than six floors to be large, emphasizing that the right to quality of life necessarily requires a guarantee of an ecologically balanced environment, and that the City Statute, by outlining instruments to protect the environment, is linked to the collective system of diffuse rights. The claim for material and moral damages was dismissed. It granted the application in part, to confirm the preliminary injunction and order the defendant to obtain prior approval of the EIV for all large-scale, multi-family residential or commercial real estate developments, with more than six floors, in the Icaraí neighborhood, in the stretch corresponding to urban fractions IC-06, IC-07 (up to Pedra Itapuca), IC-08, IC-12 and IC-14, under penalty of a fine.\r\n\r\nThe Municipality of Niterói then filed an appeal. In ruling on the appeal, the Seventeenth Civil Chamber of the Rio de Janeiro State Court of Justice (TJRJ) emphasized that the right to an ecologically balanced environment (article 225 of the Federal Constitution) includes urban planning as an integrating factor and the right to sustainable cities, which is a fundamental right, related to the guiding principles of city development (article 182 of the Federal Constitution). It understood that the EIV seeks to contemplate the positive and negative impacts of developments in relation to the quality of life of the local and nearby population. It pointed out that the principle of adaptation, included in the Paris Agreement (enacted by Federal Decree 9.073/2017) and provided for in the National Policy on Climate Change - PNMC (Federal Law 12.187/2009), requires reducing the vulnerability of natural and human systems, such as cities, to the effects of climate change. He considered that the action does not seek to declare a municipal law unconstitutional, but aims to comply with urban planning and environmental standards in order to oblige the municipality to require an EIV before approving large-scale developments, with a view to reducing urban risks and ensuring the sustainability of cities. He therefore dismissed the appeal.\r\n\r\nThe Municipality of Niterói filed a Constitutional Complaint (Rcl 35.699/RJ) with the Federal Supreme Court (STF) alleging that the TJRJ's decision violated Binding Precedents 10 and 37. On April 2020, the Complaint was dismissed in a monocratic decision and, after an interlocutory appeal, in a ruling. The First Panel of the STF held that there had been no violation of the plenary clause, in accordance with Binding Precedent 10, because the basis of the decision did not concern the unconstitutionality of the municipal law. It also concluded that the discussion deals with the prior approval of the EIV for granting a license for the construction of large-scale projects, which is not related to Binding Precedent 37. \r\n\r\nThe Municipality of Niterói filed Special and Extraordinary Appeals against the appeal decision, which were admitted by the Third Vice-Presidency of the TJRJ. The Special Appeal (REsp 1.923.322/RJ) was distributed to the Superior Court of Justice (STJ), and in August 2024 it was denied in a decision that recognized that the appealed judgment presented concrete and sufficient grounds to support its conclusions. The Extraordinary Appeal (RE 1.522.706/RJ) was distributed to the STF, and in November 2024 it was also dismissed on the grounds that the appealed judgment did not diverge from the STF's case law on the possibility of intervention by the Judiciary in public policies aimed at realizing fundamental rights. The judgments became final and the case was sent back to the lower court.",

That’s why HSBC is aiming to provide up to $1 trillion in financing and investment globally to help our clients transition to net zero”. The second poster featured an image of tree growth rings with text that stated \"Climate changes doesn’t do borders. So in the UK, we’re helping to plant 2 million trees which will lock in 1.25 million tonnes of carbon over their lifetime\".\r\nThe Advertising Standards Authority (“ASA”) received 45 complaints, including from Adfree Cities, who challenged whether the ads were misleading, because they omitted significant information about HSBC’s contribution to carbon dioxide and greenhouse gas emissions.\r\nBy ruling of October 19, 2022, the ASA upheld the complaints.\r\nThe CAP Code required that the basis of environmental claims be clear and that unqualified claims could mislead if they omit significant information.\r\nThe ASA held that consumers would understand the ads to mean that HSBC was making, and intended to make, a positive overall environmental contribution as a company. As part of that contribution, consumers would understand that HSBC was committed to ensuring its business and lending model would help support businesses’ transition to models that supported net zero targets. Additionally, they would understand that HSBC were undertaking an environmentally beneficial activity by planting trees which would make a meaningful contribution towards the sequestration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.\r\nWhilst the ads appeared in the run up to COP26, that did not mean consumers would understand the intricacies of transitioning to net zero. HSBC’s current financed emissions – emissions related to the customers it financed – stood at the equivalent of around 65.3 million tonnes of carbon dioxide per year for oil and gas alone. That figure was likely to be much higher once other carbon-intensive industries such as power and utilities, construction, transport, and coal mining had been analysed and included. HSBC also intended to continue funding thermal coal mining and power production – a type of fuel that emitted high levels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gasses – to some degree until 2040 (or 2030 in the OECD).\r\nSome level of financing would be required for natural gas and oil production to 2050. However, that meant, despite the initiatives highlighted in the ads, that HSBC was continuing to significantly finance investments in businesses and industries that emitted notable levels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gasses. Consumers would not know that was the case, and it was therefore material information that was likely to affect consumers’ understanding of the ads’ overall message, and so should have been made clear in the ads. The ads omitted this material information and were therefore misleading.\r\nThe ASA ruled that the ads must not appear again in the form complained of. The ASA told HSBC to ensure that future marketing communications featuring environmental claims were adequately qualified and did not omit material information about its contribution to carbon dioxide and greenhouse gas emissions.",

The complainant challenged whether the claim “people & planet-friendly small group adventures” misleadingly minimized the impact of Intrepid Travel’s holidays on the environment.\r\nBy ruling of May 31, 2023, the ASA upheld that complaint.\r\nThe CAP Code stated that the basis of environmental claims must be clear, and that unqualified claims could mislead if they omitted significant information. It also stated that claims must be based on the full life cycle of the advertised product, unless the ad stated otherwise, and required that marketing communications did not mislead consumers about a product’s total environmental impact. The Code further required that absolute claims were supported by a high level of substantiation.\r\nIntrepid Travel had commented that they did not offer flights as part of their travel packages, and that consumers would therefore understand that the claim was a narrow reference to their tour offering only. However, the claim was not qualified with that information. The presentation of the Giza Pyramids in Egypt within the ad, together with the claim “planet-friendly”, indicated that such tours were international and that it would be necessary to travel, in most cases by flying, to take part in their tours. \r\nThe claim “people & planet-friendly small group adventures” was an absolute claim, which would be understood to mean that taking part in an Intrepid tour caused no environmental damage throughout its full life cycle. The ASA therefore expected to see evidence which demonstrated that taking part in an Intrepid Travel tour, including the necessary travel to and from the destination location, caused no environmental damage over its full life cycle.\r\nWhilst Intrepid Travel took part in a number of environmental schemes, these did not relate to the life cycle of a holiday with Intrepid Travel, and they had not been referred to in the ad.

The ad gave the impression that renewable energy products, including renewable hydrogen, comprised a significant proportion of the energy products Repsol developed and sold, or were likely to develop or sell in the near future. \r\nRepsol’s operations in transforming several of their industrial complexes to aid in the production of renewable hydrogen would not commence until 2024, and their development and production of renewable hydrogen was not yet in operation.\r\nRepsol’s carbon emissions stood at 171 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in 2021 (50% of the emissions of the UK in 2021, 346.7 Mt CO2e), and they produced approximately 600,000 barrels of oil per day. They also had a substantial oil and gas exploration strategy, owning an interest in 40,660 acres (gross) of oil and gas development and exploration across Europe, Latin America, North America, Africa, and Asia and Oceania. Large-scale global oil and gas investment and exploration therefore formed the vast majority of Repsol’s business interests.\r\nFurther information about the proportion of Repsol’s overall business model that comprised lower carbon energy was material information that should have been included in the ad. It therefore omitted material information and was likely to mislead.\r\nThe ASA ruled that the ad must not appear again in the form complained of. It told Repsol to ensure that their future ads featuring environmental claims did not mislead by omitting significant information about the proportion of their business activities that were comprised of renewable energy, or the role renewable energy and renewable hydrogen played in their business activities.",

      "summary": "This ruling concerned a poster, a TV ad, and a YouTube ad for Shell. The poster was seen in Bristol in June 2022. It featured in large text “BRISTOL is READY for Cleaner Energy” and included Shell’s logo. The TV and YouTube ads, also seen in June 2022, depicted some of Shell’s business activities in 2022 and focused on more environmentally friendly energy products.\r\nAdfree Cities challenged whether the ads were misleading.\r\nBy ruling of June 7, 2023, the Advertising Standards Authority (“ASA”) upheld that complaint.\r\nConsumers were increasingly concerned about the environmental impact of activities related to higher-carbon products and services, and would be interested in seeking out businesses, including oil and gas companies, that were making meaningful progress towards transitioning away from higher-carbon products and services. However, they were unlikely to be aware of the details of this in relation to specific companies, and ads were therefore likely to mislead consumers if they misrepresented the contribution that lower-carbon initiatives played, or would play in the near future, as part of the overall balance of a company's activities. \r\nIn the absence of qualifying information, the cumulative effect of the ads was to give the impression that low-carbon energy products comprised a significant proportion of the energy products Shell invested in and sold in the UK in 2022, or were likely to do so in the near future. \r\nShell said they were taking steps towards net zero and promoting sustainable energy. However, according to Shell’s 2021 Sustainability Report, its operations gave rise to greenhouse gas emissions in 2021 that were estimated as equivalent to 1,375 million tonnes of carbon dioxide. Large-scale oil and gas investment and extraction comprised the vast majority of the company’s business model in 2022 and would continue to do so in the near future. Because the ads gave the overall impression that a significant proportion of Shell’s business comprised lower-carbon energy products, further information about the proportion of Shell’s overall business model that comprised lower-carbon energy products was material information that should have been included. Because the ads did not include such information, they omitted material information and were likely to mislead.\r\nThe ASA ruled that the ads must not appear again in the form complained of. The ASA told Shell to ensure their future ads featuring environmental claims did not mislead by exaggerating or, omitting material information about, the proportion of their business activities that were comprised of lower carbon activities.\r\nA related complaint, concerning the use by UK households of renewable electricity from Shell, was not upheld.

On June 12, 2022, a post was seen on the Pack’s Facebook page which featured a video that started with several images of bowls filled with vegetables. The bowls were then shown filled with dog food. The video then showed dogs eating various The Pack products. On-screen text at the end of the video stated, “THE PACK. JOIN THE PACK FOR A HEALTHIER DOG & PLANET”. A caption accompanying the video stated “Better for The Planet”. A complaint was made to the Advertising Standards Authority (“ASA”) challenging whether these claims were misleading and could be substantiated.\r\nBy a ruling of November 2, 2022, the ASA upheld that complaint. The CAP Code required that the basis of environmental claims must be clear. The Code also stated that claims must be based on the full life cycle of the advertised product, unless the ad stated otherwise. The claims in the Pack’s ad were broad and non-specific. One possible interpretation was that the products shown were less detrimental to the environment compared to their conventional meat-based equivalents across their life cycles. Because the basis of the claims had not been made clear, and were not based on a full life cycle analysis of the products, the ASA concluded the ad did not comply with the rules of the Code on environmental claims.",

The Strategy must specify objectives and the financial resources to be made available to achieve these objectives. There is also a duty to protect the “certainty and stability” of any such strategy.\r\nPursuant to the above duty, On July 6, 2022, the Secretary of State published the second cycling and walking investment strategy (“CWIS2”), covering the period 2021 to 2025. It set funding for the meeting of various of its objectives.\r\nHowever on March 9, 2023, the government made a statement to Parliament suggesting it had cut funding for active travel, previously set under the CWIS2, by two thirds. Despite there being a statutory power to vary a strategy, no such variation was made to CEIS2, despite the statement to Parliament.\r\nTransport Action Network (“TAN”) is an NGO whose objectives include helping local authorities accelerate modal shift to sustainable travel. TAN issued a public law challenge to the March 2023 statement. It argues that by making ad hoc announcements, ministers have tried to unlawfully bypass the framework set by Parliament. It is said that by cutting funding, there is now a stark and inevitable inconsistency between the active travel objectives and the funding to achieve them. Further, ministers appear to have failed to take into account the impacts on climate and air pollution targets, together with their legal duties to make facilities more accessible for people with disabilities and cycling more inclusive for children, older people and women.\r\nThe High Court initially refused permission for the claim to proceed. However, following a permission hearing on October 26, 2023, that decision was reversed, and the case will now proceed to trial, expected to take place at some point in 2024.",

      "summary": "In June 2022, the UK government granted an exploratory planning permission for UK Oil & Gas to explore for oil and gas near the village of Dunsfold in Surrey, close to an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB). This came after Surrey County Council had refused the scheme, with the government thereby overturning the Council’s decision. The claimants are now challenging the government’s decision to grant the planning permission. In July 2023, the High Court dismissed the challenge.\r\nThe claimants argued that:\r\n-\tthe Secretary of State had not complied with national policy requiring him to give “great weight” to conserving and enhancing landscape and scenic beauty as the starting point in his decision (ground 1);\r\n-\tthe Secretary of State failed to explain a key inconsistency in his decision-making, which makes it unlawful. Namely, the same day the Secretary of State allowed the project at Dunsfold, he refused permission for a similar scheme because of its potential impact on the climate due to greenhouse gas emissions. Emissions from the proposal at Dunsfold would be higher than the other scheme (ground 2).\r\nThe judge dismissed both grounds. She found:\r\n-\ton ground 1: That the Secretary of State had reached an adequate interpretation of the policies when considering exploratory planning in an area of AONB.  \r\n-\ton ground 2: The ‘similar scheme’ at Ellesmere Port was refused for distinct reasons, specifically that of climate change whereas at Dunsfold this was not the sole reason for refusal, meaning there is not an issue of inconsistency between the decisions.\r\nOn January 9, 2024 it was reported that the Court of Appeal had refused the claimants permission to appeal, bringing their challenge to an end.",

      "type": "case",
      "count": 1,
      "summary": "A disability rights activist, a campaigner trying to save his home and Friends of the Earth, have together brought a public law challenge to the UK’s ‘National Adaptation Programme 3’ (or ‘NAP3’). The claim focuses on legal compliance with section 58 of the Climate Change Act 2008, as well as breaches of human rights.\r\n\r\nOne co-claimant is a care home resident particularly vulnerable to overheating during seasonal heatwaves, the other is at imminent risk of losing his home and possessions to rising sea levels and coastal erosion. Between them they allege that NAP3 is so deficient that it breaches their human rights to: life (Article 2), home (Article 8), possessions (A1P1), and that they are discriminated against on account of their vulnerable situations (Article 14).\r\n\r\nThe case was filed on October 17,  2023, and is believed to be the first of its kind in the UK. \r\n\r\nThe grounds are as follows.\r\n\r\nGround 1 – misdirection in law as to the correct approach to setting ‘objectives’ under s58(1)(a). Rather than setting lawful specific objectives the Secretary of State has included vague ‘risk reduction goals’. The claimants consider this is inconsistent with the statutory language in s58, the overall statutory scheme, and its fundamental purpose.\r\n\r\nGround 2 – unlawful failure to consider and/or publish information on the risk(s) to delivery of the plans and proposals in NAP3. There is no evidence this assessment was done.\r\n\r\nGround 3 – unlawful failure to discharge the ‘public sector equality duty’, in not lawfully considering the unequal impacts of NAP3 on protected groups in society (such as age, race or disability).\r\n\r\nGround 4 – breach of section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998 due to unlawful interferences with the individual co-claimants’ rights under articles 2, 8, 14 and article 1 of protocol 1 of the European Convention on Human Rights. This is partly due to the failures in ground 1, but also separately due to the content and deficiencies in NAP3 itself.\r\n\r\nIn relation to Ground 4 the following issues are relevant to the co-claimants’ circumstances:\r\n \r\n-\tThe well-established but urgent need for long-term policy and protected funding to enable care-homes (and similar healthcare settings) to adapt to excessive heat. It is said this remains absent in NAP3 despite the increasing frequency and severity of annual heatwaves.\r\n-\tThere being no new policy to manage overheating risks in existing health and social care buildings, such that they are properly refurbished as soon as reasonably practicable.\r\n-\tA lack of a commitment to provide adequate resources to support communities at imminent risk of being lost to erosion and flooding, including as to the established mental health and emotional wellbeing impacts for those affected.\r\n-\tGaps, inconsistency and uncertainty in the potential allocation of funding provided for a range of areas, in particular for those communities that must (or are likely to have to) relocate and have their homes demolished.\r\n-\tThere being no insurance or compensation schemes available for the worst affected by coastal erosion and who lose their homes.\r\n-\tNo evidence of their being an express consideration, or reasoned analysis, of what a fair balance to strike would be between doing more to safeguard the human rights of vulnerable people and the interests of wider society.\r\n\r\nIn pre-action correspondence the Secretary of State has denied any wrongdoing. The claimants now await a more considered response, following which the court must decide whether to grant permission for the case to proceed to full trial. If permission is granted for judicial review, a trial would be expected in mid to late 2024.\r\n\r\nA two-day hearing occurred on 23-24 July 2024, in which the claimants challenged NAP3 on the four grounds. The court delivered its judgement on October 25, 2024, and dismissed the application for judicial review on all grounds as follows. \r\n\r\nGround 1 - The court found that the Secretary of State did not misinterpret the requirement for “objectives” in s.58 of the Climate Change Act, determining that the duty imposed by is not a single, precisely quantified, objective. \r\n\r\nGround 2 - The court found that the Secretary of State had considered “delivery risk” at various stages and there was no evidence of unlawful failure.\r\n \r\nGround 3 - The court ruled that although the initial approach of assessing the equalities implications of NAP3 did not lawfully comply with the Public Sector Equality Duty, the subsequent Equality Impact Assessment conducted solved the original error, considering quashing the belated assessment decision would serve no useful purpose. \r\n\r\nGround 4 - The court ruled that the claimants’ human rights were not breached and that the government’s adaptation strategies were in alignment with statutory requirements. \r\n\r\nThe claimants have now sought to challenge the ruling at the European Court of Human Rights as they have exhausted the domestic route. \r\n",

      "summary": "On July 6, 2023, many TotalEnergies’ shareholders sued the company TotalEnergies for unlawful dividends (article L232-12 of the French commercial code) and insincere accounts. Dividends are considered unlawful when they are distributed while profits are insufficient. Therefore, erroneous accounting can have an impact on the distribution of dividends. More specifically, erroneous information on distributable profit and on the real value of assets has a direct influence on the shareholder's assessment of whether to grant all or part of the profit to redistribution. \r\n\r\nIf the dividend is recognized as unlawful, the shareholders must return it, as provided for by the article L. 232-17 of the French Commercial Code. The distribution might also engage the liability of directors and auditors, if they have been negligent in the performance of their duties and this negligence has caused the unlawful distribution of dividends. \r\nAs recommended by the French Markets Authority, the risks arising from climate change have to be taken into account in the evaluation of cash flows and the discount rate of the assets. This conclusion is also reached on the basis of IFRS global accounting standards (IAS 36 – International Accounting Standards –Impairment tests).\r\n\r\nThe plaintiffs claim that TotalEnergies has erroneously valuated the future price of carbon and has not properly accounted for its GHGs emissions and that this has led to an overevaluation of its assets. According to the plaintiffs, first, the company does not consider the depreciation of its assets due to the future cost of carbon. Indeed, TotalEnergies uses a carbon price well below the values defined by France Stratégies which apply to entities under French law engaged in a Net Zero Emission trajectory (as TotalEnergies is). Second, TotalEnergies does not account correctly for its Scope 3 emissions and largely underestimated them. This erroneous calculation has an important impact on assets’ valuation.\r\n\r\nFollowing the rules and accounting standards, Total should depreciate many of its assets: therefore, its profits are over-evaluated and the distribution of dividends made on this valuation is unlawful. The plaintiffs claim that, as provided for by the law, Total should void that resolution that distributes dividends and claim the reimbursements of those dividends. ",

Specifically, the complaint alleges that Pasubio is sourcing leather from cattle ranching firms that operate within the forests inhabited by the Ayoreo Totobiegosode in the Gran Chaco area of Paraguay. The Ayoreo Totobiegosode are the only indigenous people living in voluntary isolation in the Americas outside the Amazon rainforest. According to the applicant, the activities of the cattle farms contribute to the deforestation of the Ayoreo lands and the violation of their human rights. Although climate change is not the main issue at the centre of the case, the specific instance explicitly addresses the link between deforestation activity and the climate emergency (p 49). Deforestation affects the natural GHG emissions absorption capacity, accelerating global warming. The complaint also mentions the Glasgow Forest Pledge, under which several multinational companies have pledged to reduce their deforestation impact. The allegations are based on, among other things, two reports by the NGO Earthsight. ",

      "summary": "In February 2022, planning permission was granted for the expansion of Bristol Airport. The decision  permitted an extra 2 million passengers per year, an increase of 20%. The decision was made on behalf of the Secretary of State by a panel of planning inspectors, and  was challenged on public law grounds by a network of members of environmental organisations and of local residents.\r\nIn January 2023, the High Court gave judgment, dismissing the claim, including the five climate-related grounds that were advanced:\r\nThe panel did not err in its interpretation of local planning policies. It was entitled to conclude that these policies did not directly address aviation emissions. The panel’s reasoning was lawful. (Paragraphs 56 to 95.)\r\nNor did the panel err in its interpretation of national policy on ‘Making best use of existing runways’, and its reasoning for this interpretation was lawful. The panel considered whether the predicted aviation emissions would have a material impact on the government's ability to meet its climate change targets and budgets. This was appropriate given the judgment in R(Goesa Ltd) v Eastleigh Borough Council [2002] EWHC 1221. (Paragraphs 96 to 121.)\r\nThe panel did not err in its approach to paragraph 188 of the National Planning Policy Framework. Under that policy the focus of planning decisions should be on whether proposed development is an acceptable use of land, rather than on the control of emissions where these are subject to separate pollution control regimes. Paragraph 188 goes on to say that planning decisions should assume that these other regimes will operate effectively. When applying this policy the panel was entitled to treat the Climate Change Act 2008 as a \"separate pollution control regime”. (Paragraphs 122 to 152.)\r\nThe panel was entitled to give no weight to evidence that the increased emissions would consume a local carbon budget for the council area. It reached this conclusion on the ground that such budgets have no basis either in law or in policy. That was rational and lawful. (Paragraph 153 to 176.)\r\nNor did the panel’s approach to the impact of non-CO2 emissions from aircraft breach the Environmental Impact Assessment Regulations 2017. The panel was entitled, in the exercise of its planning judgement, to refuse to make use of an official multiplier of 1.9 designed to take account of non-CO2 effects. On this the Climate Change Committee’s attitude was plainly of high relevance, and the Committee’s view was that non-CO2 emissions should not be included within the UK’s net zero target. Further, the developer’s environmental statement was lawful. There currently exist scientific uncertainties in assessing non-CO2 effects. It was open to those preparing the environmental statement to decide, as they did, to leave non-CO2 emissions to be dealt with until when the science enables them to be brought into account for the purposes of the Climate Change Act. As was the case in R(Friends of the Earth Ltd) v Heathrow Airport Limited [2020] UKSC 52, there was no \"space\" in the present case for the operation of the precautionary principle. (Paragraphs 177 to 198.)\r\nIn May 2023, it was reported that the Court of Appeal had refused the claimant permission to appeal the High Court’s ruling, bringing the litgiation to an end.",

      "summary": "This public law challenge concerns the grant of planning permission for exploration and assessment of hydrocarbons at a site in Balcombe, West Sussex. The decision was made by a planning inspector on behalf of the Secretary of State. The claimant is a residents association opposed to the proposed development.\r\n\r\nIn October 2023, the High Court gave judgment, dismissing the claim.\r\n\r\nThere had been no breach of the EIA regulations. First, there had been no failure to consider the ‘project’ as a whole when screening the proposal out of the EIA regime. The scheme was a single, clearly defined project limited to exploration and associated monitoring. It did not include any subsequent commercial production. Second, whilst GHG emissions were not expressly considered in the screening opinion, that was not an error of law. Whilst there would be a flare, it would have been obvious that this flare would emit GHG emissions. Further, this was a small-scale development, and the evidence overwhelmingly indicated that that GHG emissions were not a significant likely effect. (Paragraphs 41 to 61.)\r\n\r\nThe claimant also argued that the inspector should have considered the assessed and quantified level of GHG which would be emitted and he failed to do so.  However there is no requirement, whether in statute or caselaw, that every planning decision has to expressly refer to or quantify the GHG emissions that will result. Climate change is likely to be a material consideration in every planning decision given the policy context as well as the much wider issues, but that does not mean that every decision has to have reference to specific figures or assessment. Each case will depend on its own factual and policy context. Here the reference the inspector made to climate change was adequate in the context of this case. (Paragraphs 62 to 65.)\r\n\r\nOn October 31, 2023, the claimant applied to the Court of Appeal for permission to appeal the High Court’s ruling. In April 2025, the Court of Appeals rejected the claimants appeals. First, the court decided that the inspector correctly limited the scope of the assessment to exploration and appraisal phases. Second, the court found that the inspector did sufficiently consider alternatives sites. Third, the court determined that the inspector's assessment of water pollution was not flawed.  ",

      "summary": "At various dates in 2022, the Secretary of State granted development consent for three road schemes along the A47 in Norfolk, England. The schemes were all within a twelve-mile radius of the city of Norwich. They would create two new dual carriageways and develop an existing road junction. Before consenting each scheme the Secretary of State assessed the carbon emissions expected to be generated by each scheme. He concluded that, when compared with the UK’s national carbon budgets, the increase in emissions from each scheme would not be significant. \r\nThe claimant brought public law challenges to each of the three decisions. He challenged the Secretary of State’s failure to compare the combined carbon emissions from the three A47 schemes against the UK’s national carbon budgets.\r\n\r\nGiving judgment in July 2023, the High Court dismissed the claim, holding: \r\n1.\tThe question of what impacts should be addressed cumulatively; how the cumulative impacts might occur; whether the effects are likely to be significant and if so how they should be assessed are all matters of evaluative judgment.\r\n2.\tThe decision makers chose to assess the significance of carbon emission against a national target (UK carbon budgets). Other benchmarks were considered but discounted. The benchmark for the assessment of significance was a matter of judgement for the decision maker.\r\n3.\tThe use of national carbon budgets as a benchmark for the assessment of carbon emissions has been confirmed as a lawful approach (R (GOESA) v Eastleigh Borough Council).\r\n4.\tThe decision makers also proceeded on the basis that there is no geographic limit to the impact of GHG emissions. Their impact is on the global atmosphere. That is a scientific assessment to which the Court affords respect (R (Mott)v Environment Agency).\r\n5.\tIn circumstances where the significance of carbon emissions is being assessed against a national target and the impacts of GHG emissions do not have a geographical limit, there is a logical coherence to the Secretary of State’s decision not to undertake a comparison of combined emissions against the national target.\r\n6.\tWhilst compliance with relevant industry guidance does not, of itself, demonstrate compliance with Environmental Impact Assessment Regulations, it is a legitimate way for the Court to assess the exercise of judgement in circumstances where there is no single prescribed approach to the assessment of cumulative carbon impacts or to gauging the significance of the climate impacts of a development project in the context of EIA.\r\n7.\tThere is no scientific rationale for the selection of a particular collection of local schemes for comparison against a national target.\r\n8.\tThe fact that there may be other approaches to the assessment of cumulative impacts, does not take the Secretary of State’s approach outside the range of reasonable responses available to him as the decision maker, or mean that it was based on flawed reasoning.\r\n9.\tThe Court was not persuaded that his approach to the assessment of cumulative carbon emissions was unlawful and/or in breach of the IEIA Regulations.\r\n\r\nGiving judgment in February 2024, the Court of Appeal dismissed Dr Boswell’s appeal, for reasons broadly similar to those given by the High Court. The appeal focussed on the duty in the EIA regulations to consider the significance of the cumulative GHG emissions. That duty had not been breached. Carbon emissions have no geographical boundary, so their impact is not confined to the local area. This differs from other environmental impacts which are local, such as noise or flood risk, where it makes sense to consider them in conjunction with other similar impacts to see if their cumulative impact may be greater than the sum of their individual impacts measured in isolation. The decision to not compare the combined emission against the national target was logically coherent. Such an assessment would have been scientifically pointless. Nor was it required under the EIA regulations, which included no hard-edged provisions supporting Dr Boswell’s case. These were all issues of fact and evaluation for the Secretary of State, who had acted rationally.\r\n\r\nOn March 21, 2024 Dr Boswell applied to the Supreme Court for permission to appeal.

The focus of these regulations was to require the council to reach conclusions on the likely significant effects of the proposal on the environment. No criteria or thresholds had been set by which to measure the “significance” of the GHG emissions from a particular proposal. Nor was the court referred to any guidance for assessing the acceptability of that contribution, whether expressed as a percentage of national budgets or sectoral targets or otherwise.\r\nThe EIA Regulations focus on assessing the significance of an environmental effect. The legislation does not deal with the acceptability of an effect identified by environmental information. That is a matter of judgement for the decision-maker, not a hard-edged point of law. On the basis of current policy and law it was permissible for a planning authority to look at the scale of the GHG emissions relative to a national target and to reach a judgement, which may inevitably be of a generalised nature, about the likelihood of the proposal harming the achievement of that target.

In July 2023, it brought a challenge on public law grounds against the UK government’s assessment of the environmental impacts of the UK-Australia Free Trade Agreement.

Challenging this, Feedback relies on evidence that it says consistently shows that the emissions intensity from Australian beef is substantially higher than that from the UK.\r\n\r\nIt argues the UK government is bound by various legal and international obligations to take climate change, biodiversity and emissions reduction into account when setting trade policies, including the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Paris Agreement of 2015.\r\n\r\nFeedback also argues that the government’s impact assessment failed to quantify the carbon impact of any changes to domestic UK meat and dairy consumption because of tariff-free imports of Australian food. It is said the greater availability of cheaper meat on the UK market will increase consumption, and undermine recommendations from both the independent review of the National Food Strategy, commissioned by the government in 2019, and the UK Climate Change Committee (CCC), that substantial reductions in meat and dairy are essential to tackle climate change.\r\n\r\nIn February 2024, it was reported that the High Court has granted permission for the claim to proceed to a full hearing.",

      "summary": "In 2019, Parliament enacted the Impact Assessment Act (“IAA”) and the Governor in Council made the Physical Activities Regulations (“Regulations) under the IAA. The IAA and Regulations create two schemes in one: (1) sections 81 to 91 of the IAA deal with projects carried out or financed by federal authorities on federal lands or outside of Canada; and (2) the balance of the scheme deals with “designated projects” as defined in the IAA and makes them subject to federal review. Alberta’s Lieutenant Governor in Council referred tow questions to the province’s Court of Appeal that were later appealed to the Supreme Court of Canada regarding the constitutionality of the IAA and Regulations. A majority of the Alberta Court of Appeal held that the IAA and Regulations were ultra vires Parliament and unconstitutional in whole. A 5-2 majority of the Supreme Court of Canada upheld the decision in part, finding sections 81 to 91 constitutional but the balance of the scheme ultra vires and thus unconstitutional.\r\n\r\nIn the majority decision, Chief Justice Wagner concluded that the designated projects scheme exceeds federal jurisdiction for two main reasons. Firstly, the scheme focuses on a broad range of factors without specifying how they should influence the decision, shifting the decision-making away from regulating federal impacts and granting the decision maker excessive power to regulate projects beyond federal jurisdiction. Secondly, the IAA’s definition of “effects within federal jurisdiction” is overbroad and goes beyond the limits of federal jurisdiction in Canada’s Constitution, treating all designated projects the same regardless of whether federal Parliament has jurisdiction over them. This lack of tailoring to exclusive federal jurisdiction and the broad scope of “effects within federal jurisdiction” exacerbates the constitutional frailties and erodes the balance of powers in the Canadian federal state.\r\n\r\nNotably, the majority recognized that environmental protection is one of today’s most pressing challenges and that Parliament has the power to enact a scheme of environmental assessment to meet this challenge, but highlighted Parliament has the duty to act within the enduring division of powers framework laid out in the Constitution. Chief Justice Wagner also specifically noted that the matter of national concern recognized by the Supreme Court of Canada two years earlier in the GGPPA Reference – that of establishing a minimum national standard of carbon pricing of greenhouse gas emissions – does not extend to enabling the federal government to comprehensively regulate greenhouse gas emissions or sweeping regulatory powers in impact assessment legislation.\r\n\r\nA week after the Supreme Court of Canada’s decision was released, the federal government released interim guidance on the IAA, and the federal government has indicated that it will work “quickly” to introduce amendments to the IAA and Regulations. The amendments, introduced in 2024, significantly narrowed the Act’s scope, including the consideration of project-level greenhouse gas emissions when conducting environmental assessments.\r\n\r\nIn 2024, the Province of Alberta initiated a constitutional challenge before the Alberta Court of Appeal. The challenge contested the federal government’s revised Impact Assessment Act (IAA), which Alberta contends continues to centralize power in Ottawa, infringing on provincial jurisdiction over natural resources and land use. This jurisdiction is protected by Sections 92A and 109 of the Constitution Act, 1867.\r\n\r\nAlberta contends that these amendments were insufficient, continuing to grant the federal government discretion to delay or block provincially regulated projects.

The manifest prima facie illegality of the environmental endorsement, for the following key reasons:\r\n1. the lack of a transboundary impact assessment from a threefold perspective:\r\na) The size of the project and the extremely large area to be cleared (200 hectares of protected forest).  The assessment is mandatory under the Espoo Convention, including in the early planning stages.\r\nb) the transboundary nature of the underground and surface watercourses. The assessment is required under Article 3 of Helsinki Convention and Articles 20-21 of the UN Watercourses Convention.\r\nc) the transboundary nature of the climate change impacts of the project. In contravention of Article 19 of Government Decision 1076/2004 and Annex 1 of the SEA Directive, the project’s impact on climate change had not been assessed.\r\n\r\n2. Failure to undertake public consultation in the transboundary context\r\n\r\n3. Failure to carry out an appropriate assessment under Article 6(3) of the Habitats Directive (92/43/EEC) and the correspondent national statutory instrument, namely the Government Emergency Ordinance (hereinafter GEO) 57/2007\r\n\r\n4. Failure to assess climate change impacts in line with Article 19 of the Government Decision 1076/2004 in conjunction with Annex I of  the SEA Directive.\r\n\r\nII. Fulfilment of the condition of imminent harm\r\nThe plaintiff pleaded that the likelihood of harm must be assessed through the filter of the precautionary principle. In assessing whether a harm is imminent ECtHR’s approach is nuanced in the sense that the notion “imminent” has a broad meaning: where the harm is real, the ECtHR equates the reality of the harm with imminence, hence the harm is impeding and must be precluded.\r\n\r\nThis confirms the preventive nature of positive obligations. More specifically, it shows that a breach of these obligations does not only occur when the risk is close to materialising (the proverbial \"point of no return\"). Risks that threaten to occur in the long term can and must oblige the authorities to take preventive measures. Consequently, an \"acute\" danger is not required for a request for suspension to be granted, the imminence being the reality of the risk.\r\n\r\nThe Court of First Instance dismissed the application. In its reasoning, the trial judge stated that the two above-mentioned criteria were not met as the PUZ – for the Rovina mining project within the Mining Licence Area, Hunedoara County (for which the environmental endorsement was issued) would not have any possible impact on the environment, since the PUZ is an urban planning document which proposes a change in the use of the land and the functions of the area on part of the licence area and defines the applicable urban planning regulations in order to ensure the conditions for the sustainable insertion of the Rovina mining project, so that at this stage the plan for which the environmental endorsement was issued has no physical effect on the ground, but only an effect at the level of urban planning regulations.\r\n\r\nThe plaintiff appealed the judgement, and the Cluj Court of Appeal granted the appeal, reversing the lower court’s decision.\r\n\r\nJudge Iarina Prelipceanu noted, among other things, that point 14 of the Annex to the Espoo Convention makes it compulsory to initiate the transboundary procedure in the case of activities with a significant impact on the environment such as large quarries, mines, on-site mining and processing of metal ores or coal. The conditions of Annex III, point 1 of the Convention for determining the transboundary impact according to the location, size and effects of the project are also apparently met, as the project involves an area of 698.33 ha and the clearing of 200 ha of forest, and is located in the area of the Crișul Alb river and transboundary groundwater.\r\n\r\nThe defendants (Samax Romania and Environmental Protection Agency of Hunedoara) appealed against the judgement.\r\n\r\nThe appeal for annulment was heard by another bench of the Cluj Court of Appeal, which upheld the ruling of the first panel of the Cluj Court of Appeal.\r\n\r\nThe decision was based on the following cogent reasoning by Judge George Barbura - Turcu of the Cluj Court of Appeal, who held that the European Court of Human Rights has ruled that an appeal for annulment must not constitute a disguised \"appeal\" seeking a retrial of the case, because otherwise it would prejudice the presumption of validity which irrevocable judgments must enjoy and the principle of legal certainty, and as such the rule of law. The judgment under appeal sets out at length the grounds on which the Court of First  Instance’s reasoning was invalidated on the basis of the provisions of Article 18 of the  GEO 195/2005 [and] in relation to the fulfilment of the condition of imminent harm considering that there is apparently a serious impact of the administrative act on water quality, the health of the population as a result of the way the project is operated and, subsequently, the way waste is stored and disposed of, the impact on climate change as a result of greenhouse gases, carbon and the deforestation of a large area of forest.",

      "type": "case",
      "count": 1,
      "summary": "On December 1, 2022, eight UN Special Procedures on the right to adequate housing, climate change, environment, food, human rights defenders, minority issues, extreme poverty, and contemporary forms of racism, jointly issued a communication to Thailand expressing their deep concern about the (threat of) forced eviction of 14 Isan minority members (9 women, 5 men), who are also land-right defenders, from their lands and homes in the Sab Wai village. The eviction orders were issued in pursuit of climate mitigation action under forest conservation policies and legislation, without provision of alternative accommodation and productive land, nor adequate compensation. \r\nAccording to information received, Thailand’s updated nationally determined contribution (NDC) set aims to reduce GHGs by 20% compared to ‘business as usual by 2030, when compared to 2005 as the baseline year, and to achieve carbon (CO2) neutrality by 2050, and net-zero by 2065. A key strategy for meeting these objectives is to enhance forestry carbon sinks, including by reforestation, and improved conservation. The Thai government has adopted a 20-Year National Strategy, aiming to increase the country’s forested area to 55 percent of the total Thai territory by 2037 and adopted a Forest Reclamation Policy of 2014. \r\nA key complaint is that the chosen strategy for meeting NDC targets negatively impacts, and even criminalizes forest-dependent communities, including minority and indigenous peoples and small-scale farmers and those having traditionally lived in or near national parks. An important concern is that the policies criminalize any person or entity which ‘destroys’ protected forests, which could include those who traditionally live and farm in protected area.  Those concerned call the strategy a ‘false solution’ to the climate crisis, for it moves attention away from necessary energy sector reforms. Moreover, despite earlier commitments that the Forest Reclamation Policy would primarily target large-scale investors and developers, and ‘protect the poor, landless and those who had settled in an area before it was declared as protected’, the actual implementation of the forestry policy is problematic. \r\nBased on the forestry laws and policies, 14 Isan minority community members of the Sab Wai village in Chaiyaphum Province, central northeastern Thailand, are threatened by forced eviction from the lands they lived and farmed on since the 1970s, as they were identified as ‘forest destroyers’ under the current legislation. Their village is located in Sai Thong National Park, which was established in their living area in 1992. \r\nAccording to the UN Special Procedures, the evictions constitute violations of international human rights law, since the villagers are not provided with alternative accommodation or productive land, nor adequate compensation. Actions to mitigate adverse effects of climate change must take into account negative impacts on the human rights of forest dependent communities, including especially their right to adequate standard of living, including food and housing. This is closely tied to communities’ right to land as well. The UN Special Procedures reaffirm forest-dependent minorities and communities’ ‘right to land, including the right to have access to, sustainably use and manage land and forests’. They ask how the Thai government intends to protect this right through measures aimed at legal recognition of ‘land tenure rights, including customary land tenure rights not currently protected by law’.\r\nThe communication is based on Article 11 of the International Covenant on Economic Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), as further interpreted through CESCR General Comment No. 4 on the Right to Adequate Housing, CESCR General Comment No. 7 on forced evictions, and the UN Basic Principles and Guidelines on Development-Based Evictions and Displacement. The latter clarifies, amongst others, that ‘evictions can only take place in 'exceptional circumstances'; that they must be authorized by law, and ensure full and fair compensation and rehabilitation’. The communication also outlines how ‘eviction-impact assessments’ should be carried out to explore alternatives and minimization of harm that may result from an inevitable eviction. The UN Declaration on the Rights of Peasants and Other People Working in Rural Areas was also cited, in recognition that ‘peasants and other people working in rural areas have the right to contribute to the design and implementation of national and local climate change adaptation and mitigation policies’.\r\nCase specific observations on possible human rights violations and requests for further information, highlight that the Thai government’s forestry and environment-related laws and regulations, and their implementation, have discriminatory effects on specific ethnic groups and indigenous peoples, and that the Isan group more generally is subject to ‘direct and indirect, multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination’. They also ask how forest-dependent communities were consulted or participated in ‘the design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of mitigation measures affecting them’, and what the outcomes of ‘human rights impact assessments of climate change mitigation measures’ have been. Specifically, consultation with the Isan minority villagers from the Sab Wai village should explore ‘feasible alternatives to the evictions, including the possibility to remain in situ or the provision of alternative land and housing and adequate compensation, and the outcome of these consultations’.\r\nThe Permanent Mission of Thailand in Geneva acknowledged receipt of the communication, but no formal response on behalf of the Thai government is registered in the communications repository to date.\r\n",

      "type": "case",
      "count": 1,
      "summary": "On December 22, 2022, five UN Special Rapporteurs on the right to adequate housing, the right to health, rights of internally displaced persons, extreme poverty, discrimination against women and girls, issued a communication to Pakistan concerning the ongoing forced evictions and home demolitions along Karachi’s waterways (nullahs), against the backdrop of the severely negative impacts and destitution caused by the unusually heavy monsoon rains, and devastating seasonal floods of 2020 and 2022. \r\nThe evictions allegedly take place in the context of Pakistan’s climate change adaptation strategy, including implementation of a Supreme Court order that instructed the National Disaster Management Authority to remove all (informal) encroachments in and around the nullahs, due to their increased risk of flooding. Despite the Court’s ruling that people affected by the removal were to be rehabilitated, the evictions and home demolitions are allegedly carried out without consultation with the affected people and in the absence of a rehabilitation plan, and with disparate and inadequate compensation. The communication describes situations of homelessness, displacement, serious destitution, and inadequate living situations dangerous to health (e.g. overcrowding, lack of walls, rats, mosquitos and pest infestations, vector-borne and water-borne disease). It also describes how evictions and demolitions lead to loss of livelihoods for many, including especially women, as small businesses are run from their homes (e.g. tailoring).\r\nWhilst understanding the 'enormity' of the challenges facing Pakistan in the wake of catastrophic floodings, and that Pakistan has been only modestly responsible for causing climate change, the communication recalls UN human rights bodies’ previous guidance on rights-based climate adaptation, supporting that priority should be given to adaptation measures that preserve existing communities, even for those living on or near waterways and shorelines. States must consult with residents to identify the measures needed for their protection, including the possibility to remain ‘in situ’; ‘resettlement and relocation should only be considered when strictly necessitated by the unsustainability of maintaining human settlements in at-risk zones’.\r\nThe situation described in the communication violate international human rights law, including the right to an adequate standard of living, including adequate food, housing, water and sanitation, as well as adequate access to health care services. Relevant legal provisions - set out in an Annex to the communication – that govern the situation, include: Articles 6 and 17 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), pertaining to the right to life (with dignity) and right to non-interference with privacy, family and the home; Article 11 of the International Covenant on Economic Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), on the right to adequate housing, including as interpreted in CESCR General Comment No. 4 on the right to housing, and CESCR General Comment No 7 on forced evictions; and Article 12 ICESCR on the right to physical and mental health. Especially the right to housing includes a ‘right to live somewhere in security, peace and dignity', with 'security of tenure, availability of services, materials, facilities and infrastructure, affordability, habitability, accessibility, location and cultural adequacy'. An adequate house 'must protect inhabitants from cold, damp, heat, rain, wind or other threats to health, structural hazards, and disease vectors'. Other international legal guidance documents relevant to understanding the legal content of the right to housing, as related to evictions in a context of climate adaptation, include the UN Guiding Principles on Extreme Poverty and Human Rights, the UN Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement, and the UN Basic Principles and Guidelines on Development-based Evictions and Displacement. The latter spells out criteria for urban or rural planning and development planning, including in terms of ensuring rights-based information, consultation and participation. It stresses that displacement must be minimized, and that ‘eviction impact assessment’ should include exploring alternatives and strategies for minimizing harm to people and communities. In this sense, it is ‘essential that the full scope of all the environmental risks faced by informal settlements be assessed, drawing on the knowledge of inhabitants or experts hired on their behalf, since they are more familiar with the environment in which they live and have often adopted risk management practices'. Any 'immediate and effective disaster risk management measures' taken in at-risk areas, should be tailored to suit the specific needs of the community. The communication further acknowledges the specific rights of and obligations towards women in this respect, as clarified, inter alia, In CEDAW General Comment No. 37 on gender-related dimensions of disaster risk reduction in a changing climate.",

      "type": "case",
      "count": 1,
      "summary": "On November 15, 2022, seven UN Special Rapporteurs on the right to adequate housing, climate change, cultural rights, right to food, the right to health, rights of internally displaced persons, and discrimination against Afro-decendants, jointly issued a communication to the government of Colombia about the humanitarian and environmental crisis suffered by the Afro-descendant Raizal people of the islands of Vieja Providencia and Santa Catalina, after category 4 and 5 hurricanes Eta and Iota in November 2020. \r\nNearly two years later, about 5,000 people still urgently need help with basic needs, including accommodation, health care, water, sanitation and food. The increased frequency and intensity of hurricanes in this region has been attributed to climate change, and has been long known and anticipated according to the communication. Allegedly, 95% of Providencia's infrastructure, houses and the only health center on the island were destroyed during the hurricanes, and many people were displaced. \r\nThe post-disaster reconstruction efforts do not take into account the aspirations and recommendations of the Raizal people and their authorities, leading to deficient housing that ignores the Raizal’s way of life and customs, and the climatic conditions on the islands. The newly built homes are insufficiently adapted to future climate risks (e.g. adequate roof fixtures) leading to serious risk of rendering people homeless and causing death or injuries when the next hurricane hits. The Government has allegedly not improved the building code of the islands, nor ensured that infrastructure, especially health infrastructure, could withstand severe climatic events. The system of water collection for newly built homes was also insufficient. Houses in Providencia and Santa Catalina traditionally have systems of gutters and underground cisterns, used to collect rainwater and store it in tank with limited risk of being affected or destroyed by storms and lighter hurricanes. However, newly rebuilt housing lacked those essential cisterns, making the Raizal indigenous people dependent on external water supply, limiting their resilience to climatic events and contradicting the Raizal tradition of living in a self-sufficient in harmony with nature. Similar problems exist in relation to the ability to return to climate-resilient and self-sufficient ways of food production on the islands.\r\nIn September 2022, the Colombian Constitutional Court issued a judgment (T-333 of 2022) determining that fundamental rights to decent housing, drinking water, basic sanitation, health and a healthy environment of the Raizal people were not sufficiently guaranteed in the post-disaster reconstruction process. Amongst others, the Constitutional Court ordered the Government to ensure that reconstruction efforts are consistent with the Raizal’s cultural identity and strengthens the resilience of the islands in the face of the effects of climate change.\r\nThe UN Special Rapporteurs express concern that, to date, insufficient measures are taken to guarantee the Raizal’s way of life and to protect people from extreme weather events. The Raizal people have not received habitable, safe and culturally appropriate housing, nor adequate and non-discriminatory compensation for losses suffered. The Special Rapporteurs emphasise that failure to prevent the impairment of human rights caused by climate change, or refraining from mobilizing maximum of available resources to this effect, could constitute a violation of States’ human rights obligations under the ICESCR, and to take action to address the effects of climate change. \r\nAmongst relevant rights and instruments cited in support of the communication – in a separate Annex – are Articles 11, 12 and 15 ICESCR, pertaining to the right to adequate standards of living, including housing, the right to health, and right to culture; Article 17 and 27 ICCPR on the right to privacy, family and the home and right to culture of minorities; the UN Guiding Principles on Internal Displacement; and UN Framework Principles on Human Rights and Environment.\r\nOn January 13, 2023, the Colombian government responded to the UN Special Procedures’ requests for further information through a document of over 100 pages detailing how the Government approached the reconstruction process, and which legislative frameworks and processes are in place to safeguard indigenous peoples’ rights, including cultural rights. It is aware that ‘climate change deepens inequalities, compromises food security and sovereignty and aggravates public health conditions’, including through increasingly severe weather events. It also aware of ‘the need to maintain policies that increasingly make it possible to close the historical gaps of less favored populations and that put human dignity as central axis of society’.",

      "count": 1,
      "summary": "On May 18, 2023, the UN Special Procedures on the right to food, climate change, environment, freedom of assembly, human rights defenders and water and sanitation, issued a communication to France expressing their deep concern about the continued development of mega-basin projects in France, including especially for agricultural use. It considers that mega-basin projects may lead to violations of the right to environment and right to food due to difficulties for food production in regions that are heavily reliant on irrigation or with limited access to water resources. Such projects may have negative consequences by limiting livelihoods and productivity of small farmers who are already suffering economic difficulties linked to COVID-19, climate change and other constraints.\r\nMega-basin projects would mostly benefit a few large-scale agricultural industries, rather than the vast majority of smaller farmers in France, and encourage monoculture farming that requires both vast amounts of water and chemicals. Such farming practices may also lead to the production of crops for exportation mostly, adding to overall environmental costs of food production. Faced with climate change and the increased frequency, intensity and duration of droughts, these types of farming practices and related mega-basin projects would not be sustainable in the long run. The communication points to the ‘short-term profitability of the mega-basins’. Climate change poses several additional challenges to the sustainability of mega-basins projects from a perspective of human rights, notably: the impact of climate change on overall water needs across France;  the fact that storing water behind mega-dams could lead to severe evaporation of water resources; and, under pressure of heat and light the basins may be prone to formation of harmful algae and bacteria. There have been some studies conducted, but these did not detail the effects of climate change on the basis sufficiently.\r\nThe UN Special Procedures share the concerns expressed by farmers, peasants and experts that mega-basins are at odds with sustainable agricultural systems, especially in light of climate change impacts: ‘living soils capable of filtering water would allow agriculture to face the climate crisis and increasing water scarcity’, and as such mega-basins are an ‘example of poor adaptation to climate change’. To guarantee the right to food, ‘funding related to water in agriculture must be massively redirected towards the support and development of practices allowing water to be retained in the soil (e.g. agroecological practices such as plant covers, hedges, permanent meadows, peasant seeds, grassy strips)’, conserving water resources and protecting water quality.\r\nThe annex to the communication outlines the most important UN Charter-based and UN treaty-based provisions governing the right to food: Article 25 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) and Article 11 of the International Covenant on Economic Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), and further notes the relevance of the UN Framework Principles on Human Rights and Environment (2012) and Human Rights Council resolution 50/9 of 2022, which recognizes that climate change affects the realization of the right to food. The communication asks the government to provide more information ‘on existing mechanisms to involve French farmers and the organizations they represent in the consultation, mediation and decision-making process regarding mega-basin projects and ensure that their interests and concerns are taken into account’\r\nThe communication also pays considerable attention to facts and complaints related to the rights of environmental human rights defenders during peaceful protests and manifestations, and in terms of criminalisation and access to justice for people protesting against the basins.\r\nOn September 15, 2023, France responded to the communication and the various requests for information. In its response, it mostly emphasizes the questions and issues related to the human rights defenders and protests, but also outlines in some detail which (legislative) frameworks and principles cover climate adaptation action in the agricultural sector, and how public participation may take place in this respect. The response does not include a substantive reaction on how public participation has occurred in response to the contested basins, or why the basins are pursued as part of France’s ‘range of solutions’ to effectively adapt to climate change as related to ‘agriculture and biodiversity’ or ensure ‘food sovereignty as a strategic issue for the nation’.",

      "summary": "On June 26 and/or June 27, 2023, six UN Special Procedures on climate change, business and human rights, cultural rights, environment, indigenous peoples and toxic wastes, jointly issued communications to Australia and three Australian companies. The communications concern the fossil fuel activities of Woodside Energy, Australia’s largest natural gas producer, allegedly causing damage to indigenous sacred rock art and songlines in Murujuga, and to the wider objective of meeting obligations under the Paris Agreement. \r\nSpecifically, the communication addresses the expansion of Woodside Energy’s gas infrastructure in the Burrup Peninsula as part of the $16.5bn Scarborough gas project and Pluto LNG facility. The Scarborough gas resource is estimated to contain 11.1 trillion cubic feet of dry gas, and it is destined for further development through offshore and onshore (LNG) facilities.  The communication also addresses BHP Petroleum, an Australian company partaking in the Scarborough Joint Venture, and Perdaman Group, a major fertilizer production company that plans to build a fertilizer plant nearby, using a portion of the gas produced by Woodside Energy. The Scarborough Gas Project has already attracted many domestic appeals, including requests for injunctions on grounds of national law. According to a 2021 study, the Scarborough gas project will cause an estimated 1.37 billion tonnes of cumulative emissions by 2055, and result in a substantial increase of Western Australia’s GHGs emissions.\r\nIn their communications, the UN Special Procedures draw special attention to the impact of the Scarborough project on the aboriginal rock art at the sacred Murujuga site, comprising over a million petroglyphs and rock art engravings of over 70,000 years old containing sacred songlines and stories. It is nominated for UNESCO world heritage listing. Several traditional custodians of Murujuga are concerned about damage to this cultural heritage, and claim they have already suffered loss of traditional livelihoods, traditional indigenous knowledge and spiritual relationship with the land, as well as displacement and ecological degradation. \r\nThe UN Special Procedures convey their ‘most serious concern’ about the alleged human rights and environmental impacts of the project, noting that ‘climate change is having a major impact on a wide range of human rights today, and could have a cataclysmic impact in the future unless ambitious actions are undertaken immediately’. Among the human rights threatened and violated are ‘the rights to life, health, food, water and sanitation, a healthy environment, an adequate standard of living, housing, property, self-determination and development’. There is a special concern about long-standing and irreversible effects on the cultural rights of indigenous peoples due to loss of cultural elements. The relevant legal instruments providing the legal framework in this regard (set out in an Annex) include the Paris Agreement, and its references to human rights and indigenous people’s rights in the preamble; Article 6 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) on the right to life (with dignity), including in the context of environmental degradation and climate change caused by public and private actors; and Article 15 of the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) on the right to culture. The latter has been interpreted in CESCR General Comment No. 21 (2009) as including an obligation to respect and protect cultural heritage in all its forms, by preserving, developing, enriching and transmitting it, for benefit of future generations. Indigenous peoples ‘have the right to the conservation and protection of the environment’ and ‘the right to determine and develop priorities and strategies for […] the lands, territories and resources which they have traditionally owned, occupied or otherwise used or acquired’. Other relevant documents for cultural and environmental cited include the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP); UNGA Resolution 76/300 on the Right to Clean, Health and Sustainable Environment; UN Principles on Human Rights and Environment; and UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs). According to the latter, States have a duty to protect against human rights abuses within their territory and/or jurisdiction by third parties, including business enterprises, whilst Woodside Energy, BHP and Perdaman’s bear human rights responsibility to respect rights and to provide for remedies when their activities have caused or contributed to adverse impacts. The UNGPs also underscore the need for a ‘due diligence process’ by companies to ‘identify, prevent, mitigate and account for’ human rights impacts.\r\nOn 21 November 2022, Australia responded substantively by explaining how it has been consulting different traditional owner representatives, in addition to those lodging the complaint with the UN bodies. More specifically, the government must account for the ‘variety of different viewpoints’ within the community, and its ‘decision-making requires respecting the representative structures that Indigenous peoples have chosen for themselves’.  The new Australian government acknowledges ‘the inadequacies of existing legislation in protecting cultural heritage’ and notes it commitment ‘to co-design a standalone piece of cultural heritage legislation’ in partnership with a coalition of 29 Indigenous peoples member organisations from across Australia. It also outlines ‘a number of interim measures in place to address matters raised in the joint communication’, and expresses willingness to update the Special Procedures on developments in the future: ‘Australia does not shy away from fair scrutiny of our own human rights record and is willing to participate in UN accountability mechanisms’. \r\nIn November 2022, Woodside Energy and BHP also responded in some detail. Amongst others, they outlined their policies and practices related to indigenous peoples rights under UNDRIP, business and human rights under the UNGPs, as well as their corporate climate targets – without however considering whether or how the latter may be human rights compliant.\r\n",

      "summary": "On June 26 and/or June 27, 2023, five UN Special Procedures on business and human rights, climate change, environment, toxic wastes and water and sanitation, jointly issued communications to Saudi Arabia, Japan, France, USA, and the UK, and 13 financial institutions domiciled in these countries (i.e. JP Morgan, Citigroup, HSBC, SMBC, Crédit Agricole, Morgan Stanley, BNP Paribas, Goldman Sachs, Mizuho Group, Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation, Société Générale and EIG Global Energy). \r\nThe communication is also addressed to, and directly concerns, Saudi Aramco’s business activities in the fossil fuel sector. Saudi Aramco is a State-owned enterprise, owned for 98.5 per cent by the Government of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. It holds the exclusive right to explore, drill, prospect, appraise, develop, extract, recover and produce hydrocarbons, as well as to market and distribute hydrocarbons, petroleum products and liquid petroleum gas in the Kingdom. According to the communication, Saudi Amraco’s activities and business strategies are not aligned with the Paris Agreement goals, obligations and commitments, including the ambitions of the Saudi government, and Saudi Amraco’s own responsibilities for human rights protection as a business enterprise under the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights (UNGPs). \r\nSpecifically, despite Saudi Arabia’s net zero targets for 2060, and Saudi Aramco’s own ambition to achieve net zero Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 2050 across its wholly owned operating assets, the company is maintaining production of crude oil; further exploring for oil and gas reserves; expanding into fossil fuel gas; and its misrepresenting information about GHG emissions. Rather than cutting fossil fuel production and emissions ‘at the rapid rate necessary to meet the 1.5°C climate mitigation goal’, it is expanding its fossil fuel activities based on the argument that it has ‘low-cost production’ compared to other countries. \r\nAccording to the UN Special Procedures, this approach undermines ‘the ability of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to discharge its duties under international law and commitments in the context of the Paris Agreement’, and further ‘disregards Saudi Aramco’s own responsibility to reduce production to address its climate change-related human rights impacts’, as much as other companies. In fact, based on ‘the size, sector, operational context, ownership and structure of Saudi Aramco’ – including the fact that it is a State-owned company – and ‘in the context of the alleged contributions of its business operations to the severity of the human rights impacts of climate change’ over time, there is a ‘heightened expectation’ that this company takes its responsibility under international human rights law. Saudi Amraco bears ‘increased responsibility […] existing over and beyond compliance with applicable laws [...] to act fully in line with international standards and best practices to prevent and mitigate against the human rights impacts of climate change’.\r\nInternational responsibilities to protect human rights by mitigating GHGs through its own business activities and products follow from the UNGPs (2011), HRC Resolution 48/13 (2021) and UNGA Resolution 76/300 (2022) on the Right to a Clean, Healthy and Sustainable Environment, and the UN Framework Principles on Human Rights and the Environment (2018). Special attention is drawn to the report of the UN Special Rapporteur on Human Rights and the Environment on States’ obligations in relation to climate change (A/74/161), stating that ‘further exploration for additional fossil fuels’ must be prohibited because ‘not all existing reserves can be burned while still meeting the commitments of the Paris Agreement’. In addition, States must prohibit the most polluting and environmentally destructive fossil fuel activities, including ‘oil and gas produced from hydraulic fracturing’. All of this follows from the right to a healthy environment, and related human rights,  ‘including the rights to life, health, food, water, housing and culture’.\r\nIn relation to ‘access to information’, Saudi Arabia acts in violation of ‘international human rights standards that require that businesses should ensure adequate and accurate disclosure and reporting of their climate impacts in an accessible manner’. Saudi Amraco omits important information about Scope 3 emissions from its reporting and advertising, which is ‘inconsistent with the Greenhouse Gas Protocol and Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures standards’. Inaccurate information on GHG emissions can lead to underestimating the climate change crisis, and in turn, exacerbate negative human rights impact due to climate change. Therefore, all companies ‘should refrain from supporting and/or engaging in public information campaigns based on inaccurate, misleading, and unfounded assertions that harm the ability of States and the public to make informed decisions pertaining to climate change’.\r\nFinally, the communications note that Saudi Amraco increasingly sought and received private financial support from a range of financial institutions, e.g. through borrowing funds, selling bonds or equities, or getting support for financial transactions, or for investments in its oil and gas infrastructures. Each of these financial activities help finance the harmful activities of Saudi Amraco that ‘are contributing to climate change-related human rights impacts’, in a manner that is contrary to the human rights responsibilities of these financial institutions. \r\nIn August-September 2023, Japan, UK and France responded to communication, as well as Société Générale S.A., Crédit Agricole S.A., BNP Paribas, HSBC, Mizuho Financial Group, and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation. The companies all outline their respective approaches to human rights under the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights; OECD Guidelines; as well as Equator Principles, UN Global Compact or International Bill of Rights more generally.",

      "type": "case",
      "count": 1,
      "summary": "On November 27, 2023, the Supreme Court of Panama rendered a verdict declaring Article 1 of Law No. 406, dated October 20, 2023, unconstitutional. Article 1 of Law No. 406, enacted on October 20, 2023, explicitly approves the Mining Concession Contract between the State and MINERA PANAMÁ, S.A. (referred to as the 1997 Contract), asserting legislative authority to approve or disapprove contracts involving the State. This approval is conditioned on compliance with the Authorization Law, specified in numeral 75 of article 759 of the Political Constitution. The Mining Concession Contract, endorsed by Law 9 on February 26, 1997, grants MINERA PANAMÁ, S.A. exclusive rights to explore, extract, and exploit gold, copper, and other minerals in the \"Cerro Petaquilla\" area. By virtue of this Contract of 7997, MINERA PANAMÁ, S.A., has developed and operated in the area given in concession, the mining project known as \"Panama Copper Mine\", authorized under the Environmental Impact Study approved by Resolution DIEORA IA -1210-2011 of December 28, 2011, and other Environmental instruments. \r\n\r\nHowever, Law 9 of February 26, 1997, approving the 7997 Contract, was declared unconstitutional on December 21, 2017, by the plenary session of the Supreme Court of Justice. Subsequently, negotiations between the State and the concessionaire led to the formulation of a new concession contract aimed at safeguarding employment, fostering economic growth, and ensuring the State's benefit from resource exploitation. The new concession contract, executed as a result of negotiations, grants MINERA PANAMÁ, S.A. exclusive rights over specified zones for twenty years, starting from December 22, 2021. The contract includes the rights to explore, extract, exploit, benefit, process, refine, transport, sell and market the mineral metallic copper and, in conjunction with the exploration and exploitation of copper. Environmental compliance is mandated, with the mining project subject to an approved Category III Environmental Impact Study (EIS). The EIS was approved by the National Environmental Authority, today the Ministry of the Environment, through Resolution DIEORA-IA1210-2011 of December 28, 2017. The concessionaire is also obliged to adhere to environmental laws, undertake continuous improvement, and bear responsibility for environmental damages.\r\n\r\nIn challenging Article 1 of Law No. 406, Mr. Juan Ramón Sevillano Callejas contends that it violates articles 257, 259, and 266 of the Political Constitution of Panama. He asserts that the violation of article 257 stems from the non-application of the Public Procurement Law and Cabinet Decree No. 267 of 1969 during the initial Contract, which required mining concessions to be granted through fair public bidding. Additionally, the transgressions of articles 259 and 266 are alleged due to the perceived failure of the National Assembly to safeguard collective interests and uphold public interest, leading to benefits favoring the concessionaire. For example, the concessionaire benefited from a series of rights, exemptions and disproportionate tax deductions. \r\n\r\nDuring the court proceedings, several arguments were presented by members of the Supreme Court, emphasizing the violation and threat to social interests and constitutional and international regulations of a social and environmental nature. Notable dissenting opinions include concerns about constitutional principles, human rights, equality before the law, public interest, and compliance with international agreements such as the Escazú Agreement.\r\n\r\nUltimately, the Supreme Court, recognizing the constitutional conflict, determined that the clash between fundamental rights, such as the right to life, health, and a pollution-free environment, and private investment interests necessitates a resolution in favor of protecting the rights and obligations previously acquired by the Panamanian State. The decision underscores the duty of the State to guarantee a healthy environment and adhere to international environmental standards. The court concludes that the particular interests arising from private investments must not override the supreme values enshrined in the Panamanian Constitution.\r\n\r\nConsidering that in Chapter VII of Title III of the Political Constitution of Panama, recognizes the duty of the State regarding the Ecological Regime, it is necessary to cite the following norms: \"Article 118. It is the fundamental duty of the State to guarantee that the population lives in an environment \"healthy and pollution-free entity, where air, water and food satisfy the requirements for the adequate development of human life.\" Given that there is a legal relationship between the recognition of environmental obligations in the constitutional framework and respect for international standards in this matter, the State ratified, through Law 21 of 1992, the Protocol of San Salvador, recognized as additional to the American Convention on Human Rights. It recognizes the obligation of the State to protect and promote a healthy environment in Article 11. \r\n\r\nConsequently, the international policy of the Panamanian State has supported this environmental protection. Through the Stockholm Declaration, both the Panamanian State and the signatory States committed that \"the natural resources of the Earth, including air, water, land, flora and fauna, and especially representative samples of these natural ecosystems, must be preserved for the benefit of present and future generations through careful planning or management, as appropriate (Principle 1), considering that \"the Earth's nonrenewable resources should be used in a way that avoids endangering their future,\" exhaustion and ensure that all humanity shares the benefits of such employment\" (Principle 5), recognizing that \"All countries, large or small, must deal in a spirit of cooperation and on an equal footing with international questions relating to protection and improvement of the environment, it is essential to cooperate through multilateral or bilateral agreements or by other appropriate means. to effectively control, avoid, reduce, and eliminate the harmful effects that activities carried out in any sphere may have on the environment, taking due account of the sovereignty and interests of all States\" (Principle 24). For the Plenary Session of the Supreme Court of Justice, there is no doubt that we are in the presence of a constitutional conflict of a specific type, in which the fundamental rights of the Panamanian population such as the right to life, health and a healthy environment free of pollution come into collision with the particular interest arising from private investments that seek economic growth. \r\n\r\nIn effect, the Supreme Court warns that one of the incompatibilities or normative contradictions noted in this case consists of the prohibition that the Political Constitution imposes on the National Assembly related to the issuance of laws that contradict its spirit. In accordance with numeral 1 of article 163, as well as distorting the concept of retroactivity of the laws contemplated in article 46 of the Magna Carta, which were not observed when the Law Contract was approved, which is the object of the unconstitutional action under judicial scrutiny of the Court. On the other hand, a clash is observed between the fundamental rights to life, health and a healthy and pollution-free environment provided for in articles 17, 109 and 118 of the Political Constitution, which contain supreme values of the population of the Republic of Panama against the particular interest that is recognized in article 182 of the Political Constitution, which was superimposed on the contract approved with the censored Law, ignoring that these constitutional rights enjoy a special category.\r\n\r\nThe Court further reinforced the guidance of the Inter-American Commission on climate change, which calls on States to reexamine policies that affect the climate in a way that is transparent and participatory. The Law No. 406 of 2023 does not specify the environmental management instruments that would allow effective access to information about environmental adaptation programs, mitigation measures, and effective compensation for affected populations. This is contrary to Principle 13 of the UN Guiding Principles of Business and Human Rights, which stipulates that \"The responsibility to respect human rights requires that companies\": \"Seek to prevent or mitigate the negative consequences on human rights directly related to their operations, products, or services provided through their business relationships, even when they have not contributed to generating them.\"\r\n\r\nThis aspect is important because, despite the State presenting clauses that could be considered insufficient in light of human rights protection instruments, such as citizen participation and environmental law, the contracting company could not bypass them by arguing that it did not bear that responsibility. The Plenary of the Supreme Court of Justice of Panama believes that companies, in their management and economic activities, cannot leave the task of protecting human rights solely to the contracting State. They also have a duty of respect, which in this case was materialized in the stipulation of clauses that were effective in reducing, mitigating, and preventing social and consequential consequences.\r\n\r\nThe Court also emphasized that the law in question violates the rights of children (art. 56 of the constitution), especially considering the state of the climate in which we inserted. This calls on States to observe the precautionary principle in its decisions. In this sense, the Court specifically refers to the Committee on the Rights of the Child General Comment 26 on Child Rights and the environment, with a special focus on climate change. ",

      "count": 1,
      "summary": "On October 27, 2020, the State of Rondônia and the Rondônia State Public Prosecutor's Office (MPRO) filed a Public Civil Action (ACP), with a request for injunctive relief against several individuals who invaded the area of the Guajará-Mirim State Park and its buffer zone, a region called “Bico do Parque”, without authorization from the competent body. The news of the invasion of the areas by around 70 people was received by the State Secretariat for Environmental Development (SEDAM) and the military police in September 2020, and the suppression of native vegetation and the construction of buildings were found. After the intervention of the state authorities, the private individuals vacated the park area. Still, they continued in its buffer zone and more people joined the group of occupiers, threatening to invade the conservation unit again. As an injunction, the authors request: (i) to order the defendants to refrain from entering the state park and to withdraw from its buffer zone; (ii) for the bodies with police powers to notify the defendants and negotiate the non-occupation of the areas and their withdrawal, while maintaining surveillance at the site. On the merits, it is requested that the requests for urgent relief be confirmed and that the defendants be ordered not to occupy the areas in question, under penalty of a daily fine.\r\n\r\nOn November 5th, 2020, the request for injunctive relief was granted and a judgment was handed down against the occupants of the areas, ordering them to vacate. The defendants filed an appeal. \r\n\r\nOn November 21st, 2023 a judgment was handed down ruling on the appeal and this is the procedural document that contains an express discussion directly related to climate change.\r\n\r\nIn arguing the merits of the case, the ruling emphasized the importance of the Guajará-Mirim State Park for preserving biodiversity in the state of Rondônia. It was emphasized that illegal possessions cannot be converted into legal ones in order to implement agricultural projects that disregard the importance of the Amazon biome. It was argued that climate change has led to a recommendation to create conservation units and that Brazil is the sixth country with the highest greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, 60% of which come from land use, land use change and forestry sector. In addition, the ruling explains the impacts of deforestation on water security, climate, soil, air, biodiversity, health, the lives of future generations and the economy. It highlighted Advisory Opinion 23/2017 of the Inter-American Court of Human Rights, which stated that the effects of climate change affect the realization of human rights. In addition, it argued that the Brazilian legal system, due to the socio-environmental function of property, does not support property that harms the rights of others. It concludes that the occupation of the areas that are the subject of the lawsuit is recent and that current legislation does not allow anthropization in these places.

      "summary": "The environmental charity, the Lifescape Project, has launched a public law challenge to the Secretary of State’s Biomass Strategy. The strategy sets out government policy on the role of sustainable biomass in reaching net zero. The claimant relies on the UK Climate Change Act 2008, filing its challenge in November 2023.  \r\n \r\nThe Biomass Strategy, which was published August 2023, describes Biomass Energy with Carbon Capture Storage (BECCS) as a “low carbon fuel source”. This is despite, says the claimant, experts doubting its ability to help meet climate targets and be considered as renewable energy. For instance, it is said the strategy does not consider the lifecycle emissions such as through manufacturing and combustion of the biomass. \r\n \r\nBECCS involves the burning of biomass then the capturing the carbon emissions generated and storing them below ground. This process is sometimes described by its promoters as “carbon negative”, on the basis that the carbon released by burning wood is also absorbed by newly planted trees.  \r\n \r\nHowever, according the claimant this method is expected to cost billions. It is said forest ecosystems will be threatened as the method is reliant on existing forests before sourcing from afforested areas can begin. There are argued to be other lower cost forms of renewable energy that can reliably deliver emission reductions.  \r\n \r\n \r\nThe grounds are as follows:  \r\n \r\n1.\tThe Secretary of State acted irrationally by failing to conduct an adequate analysis of the extent to which the government’s continued support for the combustion of biomass, including forest biomass, will achieve genuine reductions in carbon emissions or otherwise contribute to meeting carbon budgets and the Net Zero Target. \r\n2.\tFurther or alternatively, such a failure breached the Secretary of State’s duty under section 13 of the Climate Change Act 2008 to have policies and proposals that will enable the carbon budgets to be met.  \r\n3.\tThe consultation exercise that preceded its publication was unfair, because the underlying scientific analysis relied upon was not disclosed to consultees, who were as a result deprived of the opportunity to comment",

In general terms, the NOM-163-SEMARNAT-ENER-SCFI-2013 establishes that, for certain car models, they must obtain a certificate of environmental compliance, and certify that their cars comply with certain carbon dioxide emissions parameters. One of the purposes of this Mexican Official Standard is to prevent atmospheric pollution and thus combat climate change.\r\n\r\nKia Motors was sanctioned with two different fines, for: 1) not having obtained the NOM Certificate of Environmental Compliance and, 2) not having accredited compliance with the criteria for the acceptance of carbon dioxide emissions, because the corporation failed to meet its environmental obligations to reduce CO2 emissions from their 2016 model year vehicles. However, PROFEPA imposed, for both sanctions, 7 fines, one for each car model. \r\n\r\nOn August 11, 2022, regarding the first sanction, the Federal Tribunal of Administrative Justice decided that the fine, in relation to the Certificate of Environmental compliance was illegal. The Tribunal also decided that Kia could not be sanctioned for the same conduct 7 times. Considering that it was a single infringing conduct, only one fine could be applied, not 7.\r\n\r\nPROFEPA filed an appeal on November 17, 2022, arguing that Kia should be fined for the 7 models of cars marketed, because each automotive line and model must comply with the carbon dioxide reduction, as each line and model has different specifications. By not complying with the NOM, none of the 7 models complied with the CO2 emission limits. PROFEPA made the example in its appeal that sanctioning the company with a single fine would be equivalent to a person who deprives a hundred people of their lives, being sanctioned only once for the crime of deprivation of life.\r\n\r\nThe Collegiate Court that heard the appeal, on September 22, 2023, decided that (1) the two sanctions were legal and that (2) based on Article 4 of the Constitution, which protects the right to a healthy environment, the \"polluter pays\" principle, the principle of prevention and the principle of in dubio pro natura, the company had to be fined for each model of automobiles.\r\n\r\nThe above, first, because environmental administrative law must function as an effective instrument in the prevention of environmental damage and, with it, dissuade potential offenders from committing damage to the environment. Second, because this interpretation of the NOM allows the protection of the right to a healthy environment and the fight against climate change.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the decision of the Collegiate Court, the Federal Tribunal of Administrative Justice must issue a new decision with the new considerations issued by the Collegiate Court.

The Applicants were Ncumcara Community Forest Management Committee, Muduva Nyangana Communal Conservancy Management Committee, Katope East Community Forest Management Committee, Kavango East, as well as West Regional Conservancy and Community Forest Association. Reconnaissance Energy Africa is a Canadian oil and gas exploration company. In 2019, Reconnaissance Energy Africa obtained a permit allowing them to carry out exploratory oil drilling in part of the Okavango Delta. The Namibian Authorities later amended the license. Subsequently, the Applicants objected to the amendments in a letter to the Environmental Commissioner, dated May 27, 2022. The Applicants did not receive any response. In June 2022, the Applicants appealed to the Minister against the Environmental Commissioner’s decision, asking for the decision allowing the drilling to be rescinded or reviewed. The complaint was unanswered by the Minister. \r\n\r\nThe Applicants then filed a complaint before the Namibian High Court to make the court oblige the Minister to respond and prohibit further drilling. The case was heard on July 13, 2022.  The Applicants claimed that their rights were infringed due to the drilling on community-managed land, already endangered due to climate change, and that the local communities were not adequately consulted as per Namibian law. Further, the Applicants claimed that the drillings are putting the region’s sole freshwater source at risk for pollution and exposing already endangered wildlife to further risk. The Kavango Delta is a large freshwater wetland, supplying drinking water to a region prone to drought, worsened by climate change, and home to a large number of animal and plant species. The Applicants asked the High Court of Namibia for an urgent interim injunction prohibiting further drilling for oil in the Kavango Delta. The High Court held that it did not have jurisdiction, as the Environmental Management Act (Sec. 50) reserves the right to decide on the appeal for the Minister. The High Court considered that intervention would be possible only if the Minister refused to make any decision or if the Minister had already made a decision. On July 29, 2022, the High Court rejected the Applicants’ requests. Thereby, Reconnaissance Energy Africa is allowed to continue with the drillings. The Applicants were ordered to pay legal costs. ",

This lawsuit is part of a set of 6 environmental class-action filed against the 4th Bid Cycle for oil exploration blocks. The aim is to challenge the auction of oil exploration blocks held through the 4th Cycle. The plaintiffs argue that the inclusion of a set of blocks located in the Paraná and Amazonas Basins is illegal, as they overlap with areas of influence or restriction of 23 indigenous lands, and there was no prior, free and informed consultation process. They claim this is a case of environmental racism, since the proximity of the exploration blocks to indigenous lands poses risks to health, the environment and the use of the territory by the peoples who live there. They state that the climate crisis scenario requires an energy transition towards clean energies and a reduction in GHG emissions, which is incompatible with the expansion of oil exploration. Furthermore, they affirm that indigenous lands are essential for combating this crisis, as they are barriers against deforestation and forest degradation and their inhabitants are the main guardians of the environment. As a preliminary injunction the plaintiffs request the suspension of the offer of the contested exploration blocks in the 4th Bid Cycle, until the protection of indigenous rights is observed. On a definitive basis, they request that the contested blocks be excluded from the Bid Cycle until the affected indigenous rights are consulted.\r\n\r\nOn December 19, 2023, the court rejected the request for an injunction and partially rejected the initial petition regarding the blocks located in the Paraná Basin, as it considered that they did not fall within its jurisdiction. The court ruled that there was no longer any procedural interest in challenging some of the exploration blocks since, when the auction took place, only two blocks (AM-T-107 and AM-T-133) were auctioned off, and the proceedings should continue only in relation to them. Also, Atem Participações S.A. was included as a necessary co-litigant, as it was the bidder for the exploration blocks. This preliminary injunction does not mention climate change.\r\n\r\nIn March 2024, IBAMA and ANP presented their defenses, stating that there is no overlap between the blocks on offer and indigenous lands. They emphasized the economic benefits of oil exploration for Brazilian society and that in the International Energy Agency's NetZero 2050 scenario, the energy matrix will still rely on oil and natural gas as primary energy and that the impacts of greenhouse gas emissions from the projects can be assessed in the environmental licensing phase under the financial burden of the entrepreneur. The ANP clarified that it promotes social participation before bidding for oil and natural gas exploration rights. They emphasized that simply holding an auction process does not impose a risk on the environment. On March 4, 2024, the Federal Government filed its defense. In addition to addressing the licensing issues already dealt with by other federal bodies, claimed that the offer of the contested blocks is technically supported by the rules issued by the competent bodies. In March 2024, Atem Participações S.A. filed a defense in which it stressed that the bidding process does not pose a risk to the environment and that all the impacts of the projects to be explored will be assessed during the environmental licensing phase.",

In September 2023, the High Court gave judgment, dismissing the challenge. \r\n\r\nThe Secretary of State had not acted unlawfully in his approach to the sixth carbon budget, which covers the period 2033 to 2037. It was said against him that he provided no analysis of the implications for the budget, that he failed to grapple with the quantified adverse effects of the scheme, and that the policies relied on were aspirational and their success inherently uncertain. However these were disagreements with the merits. The Secretary of State’s approach to the sixth carbon budget was clearly but succinctly set out. He relied on the new policies - in the Transport Decarbonisation Plan and the Jet Zero Strategy - as measures that would accelerate decarbonisation in the aviation sector and ensure carbon budgets were met without directly limiting aviation demand. He was entitled to rely upon his own policies, which had not been the subject of any successful legal challenge, to deliver the outcome for which they were designed, namely achieving the carbon budgets which had been and were to be legislated without impacting upon aviation demand.\r\n\r\nNor had the Secretary of State failed to take into account a relevant consideration, namely that the modelling work for the Jet Zero Strategy did not take account of Manston Airport. Seen context, the omission of Manston from that modelling was not of significance to the decision. The modelling was simply a tool to assess the validity of the policy and nothing more.\r\n\r\nOn February 7, 2024 it was stated on the claimant’s CrowdJustice page that the Court of Appeal had granted her permission to appeal against the High Court’s dismissal of the claim. An appeal hearing will therefore follow. It appears, however, that the appeal will only consider the non-climate grounds, which relate to the need case for the airport. It will not consider the climate grounds, as permission was apparently refused for those grounds to proceed to appeal.\r\n",

      "summary": "This is a constitutional claim against the South Korean Government for failing to provide constitutionally required protection of the fundamental rights of the plaintiffs from the threat of climate change by setting the national climate target at “more than 35% from 2018 levels” in the Art. 8 para. 1 of the Carbon Neutrality Act. \r\nThe 123 plaintiffs are members of the civil society organization, leaders of political parties, and general citizens affected by climate change. The claimed rights include right to life, right to pursue happiness, right to general freedom, right to property, right to healthy environment, State’s obligation to provide its people from disasters, and State’s obligation to protect the fundamental rights of the people. \r\n\r\nThe plaintiffs argue the 35% threshold set by the provision of the law (i) depletes South Korea’s per-capita-based carbon budget for 1.5 degrees and 1.7 degrees before 2030, (ii) falls short of the global reduction pathway presented in the IPCC 1.5 Special Report, and (iii) contributes to the Emission Gap pointed out by the UNEP. The plaintiffs further argue that the provision of the law does not prescribe the specific standards and criteria for delegation as required by the Constitution. \r\n\r\nOn February 19, 2024, the Court merged the case with two other constitutional cases challenging the same NDC, and one case challenging the implementation plan of the NDC, the 1st Carbon Neutrality Basic Plan. The Court also set a public hearing for the case on April 23, 2024.\r\n\r\nOn August 29, 2024, in a unanimous decision, the Constitutional Court found that Article 8 Paragraph 1 of the Framework Act on Carbon Neutrality and Green Growth violates the right to healthy environment under Article 35 of the Constitution, and ordered the National Assembly to amend the law by February 28, 2026.\r\n\r\nThe Constitutional Court first acknowledged that the right to healthy environment under Art. 35 of the Constitution addresses the harm and risks related to climate change and that the State has an obligation to protect such rights by mitigating the cause of climate change and reducing the harm by adapting to climate change. The Court then ruled that in order to appropriately address such issue, the State's measures on climate change (i) must be based on South Korea's share of efforts in light of the global efforts based on scientific facts and international standards, (ii) should not impose excessive burden to the future, and (iii) must be based on legal framework that ensures continuous reduction of greenhouse gas.\r\n\r\nIn light of these standards, the Court ruled that Art. 8 Paragraph 1 of the Act has failed to meet these standards by not prescribing any targets or plans between the period 2031 - 2049, which inevitably results in postponing of reduction efforts. The Court also ruled that the provision violated the \"principle of legislative reservation\" stating that the the framework of the reduction pathway up to 2050 must be set by law, by the Legislature, considering its implications on various fundamental rights, and the fact that the future generation has limited opportunity to present its interest in the process.\r\nOn the 2030 reduction target set by the Enforcement Decree, the Court ruled that it is unable to identify a single standard or criteria to determine the appropriate share of South Korea in the global efforts and therefore cannot conclude that the target is in violation of the State's obligation. However, the Court also stated that it does not mean the State is doing its best on climate mitigation.\r\n\r\nOn the Carbon Neutrality Plan, the Court was divided. The majority, 5 justices, opined the Carbon Neutrality Plan is unconstitutional because the 40% reduction is based on \"gross emission\" of the base year 2018, and \"net emission\" of the target year 2030. Because the base year excludes carbon removal by LULUCF and the target year includes carbon removal by LULUCF, the majority opinion ruled that the actual reduction efforts of the plan does not meet the stated 40% and has violated the mandate of the Enforcement Decree. On the other hand, 4 justices dismissed the claim stating that because the language of the provision of the Act did not distinguish gross emission and net emission, such discrepancy would not amount to unconstitutionality.

Among other arguments, the plaintiff alleged irregularities in the process through which the Decree was enacted (failure to take into consideration public participation) and that the Decree would allow, as part of the consented fracking activities, excessive and illegal consumption of water, which is a scarce and specially protected resource in the Province. Furthermore, the plaintiff warned about the potential use of products with radioactive content in the fracking operations and the underestimation of risks related to volcanoes located in the Province. Different legal grounds are used by OIKOS, including the constitutional right to a healthy environment (Article 41 of the National Constitution), the General Law of the Environment (Act 25.675), the Hazardous Waste National Act (Act 24.051), environmental principles (progressivity, prevention, precaution, intergenerational equity), the Mendoza Constitution and the provincial environmental act (Act 5691). Climate change is only a passing reference in the lawsuit, which merely mentioned the UNFCCC to refer to the precautionary principle. \r\nConcerns and arguments related to the climate impact of fracking activities were brought in the case through three amicus curiae filed by the Fundación Ambiente y Recursos Naturales (FARN, December 2020), EarthJustice (January 2021) and the International Association for Environmental Defense (AIDA, February 2021). In these submissions, among other concerns, the ENGOs highlighted the climate impacts of fossil fuel production (both CO2 emissions of future combustion and CH4 leaks) and alleged that those impacts were not duly considered when making the decision (cost-benefit analysis) and that they could imply a breach in Argentina’s international commitments. AIDA’s submission also observed that, in October 2018, the UN Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights recommended Argentina to reconsider the exploitation of Vaca Muerta’s oil and gas reserves in light of the climate commitments under the Paris Agreement and the scarcity of the global carbon budget. \r\n\r\nIn 2023, the Centro de Estudios Legales y Sociales (CELS), the Center for International Environmental Law (CIEL); and the Environmental Law Alliance Worldwide (ELAW USA) also presented amici curiae.\r\n\r\nOn August 26, 2024, the Mendoza Supreme Court accepted the amicus brief submitted by Fundación Ambiente y Recursos Naturales (FARN, December 2020) and rejected the rest of them.

The project, intended for the extraction of copper and molybdenum and located in the Metropolitan Region of Santiago, 65 kilometers from the city of Santiago, is challenged due to alleged illegalities in the resolution.\r\n\r\nThe contested resolution seeks to continue the exploitation of the \"Los Bronces Integrados\" mining project, owned by Anglo American S.A., which was approved in different resolutions in 2007 and 2015. Afterward, the company requested new permission to optimize and adapt the original exploitation plan. On April 22, 2022, the SEA resolved that the project holder did not provide sufficient information to rule out the generation of health risks for the population, deciding to unfavorably qualify the project because it did not adequately determine the area of influence of the air quality component of the project, nor did it provide enough information to rule out health risks to the population, according to Articles 11(a) and 16(4) of Law No. 19,300, and Articles 2(a), 5, 18(d), and 62 of the SEIA Regulations. \r\n\r\nAgainst the negative resolution, nine administrative appeal claims were filed, and the project proponent submitted additional background information. On April 14, 2023, the claimants opposing the project also provided further background information, which, according to them, was not considered by the administrative authority and was violating their rights. It is explained that on November 8, 2023, the Executive Director of the Environmental Assessment Service, acting as the secretary of the Committee of Ministers, decided to reject the appeal claims filed by the non-proponents of the project and instead to accept the appeal claim filed on behalf of the project's proponent, thereby qualifying the \"LOS BRONCES INTEGRADO\" project environmentally favorable.\r\n\r\nThe claimants allege that Resolution Exempt No. 202399101873, dated November 8, 2023 (R.E. 202399101873/2023), which favorably qualified the project, fails to fulfill Chile's climate obligations and human rights commitments, including the lack of consideration of the climate factor in the Environmental Impact Assessment.\r\n\r\nThey add that the resolution that qualifies the project as environmentally favorable is illegal because the project poses a serious threat to the nearby glaciers in its area of influence, will increase the water scarcity already affecting the Metropolitan and Valparaiso Regions, will increase atmospheric pollution and harm the health of the population, generating an atmospheric catastrophe and severe damage to ecosystems. They argue that the project threatens serious human rights violations, such as the right to health, the right to live in a healthy environment, the right to life, the right to food, and the right to water, and that the contested act violates the precautionary principle.\r\n\r\nThe claimants request that the SEA invalidate the resolution that environmentally qualified the project as favorable, arguing that it contradicts the law. Concurrently, while the invalidation request is being processed, they seek an interim provisional measure to immediately suspend the effects of the contested act or any other appropriate measure.",

The plaintiffs allege that Total failed to adequately assess the project's threats to human rights and the environment and claim compensation for these alleged violations. This lawsuit follows a previous case that has been dismissed (Friends of the Earth et al. v. Total), where plaintiffs claimed for an injunction. As the alleged damages have since occurred, the plaintiffs now claim compensation.\r\n\r\nUnder the 2017 French Duty of Vigilance Law, incorporated in the French Commercial Code in articles L225-102-4 and L225-102-5, French companies must identify and prevent, in a due diligence plan (plan de vigilance), serious violations of human rights and to the environment that could occur as a result of their business practices, including at the level of their foreign subsidiaries and subcontractors. \r\n\r\nThe plaintiffs claim that these shortcomings of the vigilance plan have caused damages to the rights of the members of the communities affected, and, in particular:\r\n\r\n(1) People affected by the Tilenga and EACOP projects were deprived of the free use of their land even before receiving compensation, and this for more than three or four years, thus violating their property rights.\r\n(2) This has led to the deprivation of their means of subsistence, resulting in severe food shortages and even famine, thus violating their right to adequate food.\r\n(3) From 2022, land in some villages was affected by flooding caused by the construction of the Tilenga project's processing plant (CPF).\r\n(4) Only a minority of people were able to benefit from compensation in kind, and for the others financial compensation was largely insufficient.\r\n(5) In many cases, the transfer of land to Total was the result of pressure and intimidation, and the consent of those affected was therefore vitiated. \r\n(6) Several plaintiffs were threatened, harassed and arrested simply because they dared to criticize the oil projects in Uganda and Tanzania and defend the rights of the affected communities.\r\n\r\nPlaintiffs claim that Total has not identified the risks relating to these risks in its vigilance plan; failed to act even though it was in a position to identify these risks before they occurred, and when it had been alerted about their existence; failed to implement corrective measures once the violations had occurred, even though it had been alerted about their existence. \r\n\r\nArticle L225-102-5 of the French Commercial Code provides that : «under the conditions laid down in Articles 1240 and 1241 of the French Civil Code, failure to comply with the obligations defined in Article L. 225-102-4 of this Code entails the liability of the non-complying subjects and obliges them to compensate for the damage that could have been avoided by complying with these obligations.» \r\n\r\nThe plaintiffs claim compensation for the aforementioned damages they have incurred because of the violation of the Law on the Duty of Vigilance.\r\n\r\nIn the most recent stage of the case, plaintiffs filed a motion requesting the court to order Total Energies to disclose documents necessary for assessing the company’s compliance with its legal obligations under the French Duty of Vigilance Law. The requested documents include non-public TotalEnergies reports used for calculating compensation amounts for individuals who were evicted, a study on construction-induced floods, and internal audits.

It argues the decision was unlawful as the likely harmful environmental effects were not assessed or taken into account, in breach of the relevant environmental impact assessment (EIA) regulations. Specifically it is said the regulations were breached:\r\n\r\n•\tBy zero-rating the carbon (CO2) emissions from biomass burning, i.e. treating it as producing no greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, despite the obvious and indisputable fact that the combustion of biomass releases huge quantities of GHG emissions \r\n•\tBy excluding the CO2 emissions from the units to be fitted with the carbon capture technology \r\n•\tBy treating the works to construct and operate transport and storage facilities for captured carbon as a separate project. \r\n\r\nBiofuelwatch argues the Humber Low Carbon Pipelines Project to transfer the CO2 and store it in rock formations under the North Sea is essential for the Carbon Capture Usage and Storage (CCUS) to operate as a whole and should have been treated as the same project for EIA purposes.\r\n\r\nThe impact of these errors on the decision is said to be significant, on the basis they allowed the energy secretary to treat the project as resulting in a net reduction in emissions of 7,975,620 tCO2e per annum.\r\n\r\nThe next step is for the High Court to decide whether to give permission for the claim to proceed to a full hearing.",

The application is based on the ground that the Environmental Impact Report (EIR) utilized by the DG and Minister to inform their decision did not adhere to the stipulated requirements outlined in the National Environmental Management Act 107 of 1998 (NEMA) and the Integrated Coastal Management Act 24 of 2001 (ICMA).\r\n\r\nThe issue is whether the decision to grant environmental authorization to conduct exploratory drilling off the South-West coast should be set aside in that it was taken without proper assessment of the environmental impacts of the proposed project. In praying for the authorization to be set aside, it is the contention of the applicants that the decision to grant environmental authorization was made without a thorough assessment of the environmental ramifications of the proposed project, as the EIR fails to meet the standards set forth by NEMA and ICMA. The EIR failed to consider climate change impacts associated with the use of any oil or gas discovered by the Proposed Project and to evaluate potential trans-boundary impacts of an oil spill resulting from a well blowout, particularly concerning contamination in Namibian waters and international waters. It does not adequately assess the extent of socio-economic impacts, including potential revenue losses for fishing operations and coastal communities in the area. The authorisation itself flouts section 24 of the Constitution of the Republic of South Africa which guarantees the right to a healthy environment, protected for present and future generations. It infringes on the environmental impact assessment principles in National Environmental Management Act (NEMA) enacted to give effect to the constitutional rights related to environmental protection. Consequently, the decisions made regarding the environmental authorization for the proposed project are legally flawed and subject to review and potential reversal under the Promotion of Administrative Justice Act (PAJA).\r\nIn relation to jurisdiction, GREEN CONNECTION NPC and NATURAL JUSTICE   assert that the requirements for loca standi and jurisdiction have been satisfied, in that the application is brought in their own interest, in the public interest in terms of section 38(1)(c) of the Constitution and section 32(1)(d) of NEMA and in the interest of protecting the environment in terms of section 32(1)(e) of NEMA, and that the adverse effects of the decisions under review will be experienced in the Western Cape. Hence, the Court has jurisdiction in terms of section 1 of the Promotion of Administrative Justice Act 3 of 2000 (PAJA).\r\n\r\nThe Western Cape High Court has heard the case, and TotalEnergies told the court that there is a 1 in 7,000 chance of an oil spill occurring from the block.

The scheme would replace the existing surface-level section of the road.\r\n\r\nThe claimant company, formed by objectors to the proposal, issued a public law challenge. They were joined by a co-claimant who was a local landowner. The challenge was heard at a ‘rolled-up hearing’, at which the application for permission to bring the claim, and the substantive claim itself, were heard together. The High Court gave judgment in February 2024. The hearing and the judgment concerned only the first six of the claimants’ seven grounds. The seventh ground was stayed for later determination.\r\n\r\nFor the six grounds that were considered, the court refused permission. Two of those grounds related to climate change.\r\nThe first alleged the Secretary of State failed to have regard to an obviously material consideration, namely the government’s Carbon Budget Delivery Plan and its Net Zero Growth Plan, both issued in March 2023. This ground was unarguable. The Secretary of State had rightly focused on the relevant national policies, including that any increase in carbon emissions was not a reason to refuse consent, unless the increase was so significant it would have a material impact on the ability of government to meet its carbon reduction targets. The Secretary of State concluded the scheme would have no such impact. The court held that the material now relied on by the claimants provided no basis for undermining that conclusion. (Judgment paragraphs 224 to 243.)\r\n\r\nThe second of the climate grounds considered related to the National Networks National Policy Statement (“NPSNN”), being the relevant national policy. The NPSNN was adopted in 2014, before the UK’s current climate budgets and targets were set. The ground alleged the Secretary of State failed to consider not applying the NPSNN and/or he acted irrationally in not departing from the NPSNN in relation to climate change, given that that policy was being reviewed at the time of the decision, because it did not take into account the UK’s current climate obligations. This ground was unarguable. The Secretary of State was not responsible for UK-wide compliance with climate obligations – that fell to a different secretary of state. There were serious doubts over whether the claimants were even entitled to pursue this ground, giving the NPSNN had not been suspended pending review, and given the wording of the Planning Act 2008. However the ground was unarguable in any event. In reaching the decision the Secretary of State had considered the implications of the scheme for the net zero target and carbon budgets. He had therefore considered the matters which led him to decide that a review of the NPSNN should be carried out. There was no arguable legal error in his decision making. (Judgment paragraphs 244 to 256.)\r\n\r\nThe judgment disposed of the claimant’s first six grounds of challenge. The remaining ground alleged that the Secretary of State’s approach to environmental impact assessment was unlawful in relation to the cumulative effect of GHG emissions from the scheme and other committed road schemes. The High Court had previously stayed this ground pending the decision of the Court of Appeal in R (Boswell) v Secretary of State for Transport [2023] EWHC 1710 (Admin). (See judgment paragraphs 60, 64 and 257.) \r\n\r\nThree days after the High Court’s judgment, the Court of Appeal gave judgment in Boswell, dismissing that appeal. It is not known whether the remaining Stonehenge ground of challenge has been settled in light of the Boswell ruling, or whether the Stonehenge claimants have sought to appeal to the Court of Appeal.",

      "summary": "The defendant was a member of a political group which asserts climate change is an emergency and anything short of immediate and substantial change will lead to terrible consequences for the planet and the human race. \r\n\r\nIn July 2020, she, together with others, agreed to target the offices of various environmental NGOs. At each premises the group asked to hand in a letter and then proceeded to throw pink paint and to attach copies of the letters to the premises. The letters drew attention to the climate emergency and what they saw as the culpable inaction of those targeted. \r\n\r\nIn August 2020, similar events, involving the defendant and others, took place at the headquarters of the major UK political parties. At one of these headquarters, one defendant took out a glass hammer and smashed a window. \r\n\r\nFinally, it was alleged that the defendant and others agreed to target the headquarters of various trade unions, but this agreement was not put into effect. \r\n\r\nThe defendant was prosecuted for conspiracy to damage property. At her Crown Court trial she gave evidence that she believed the occupiers of the premises would have consented to the damage had they been aware it was carried out to alert those responsible for the premises to the nature and extent of man-made climate change. This was in support of her “lawful excuse” defence under section 5(2)(a) of the Criminal Damage Act 1971. \r\n\r\nThe defendant was acquitted by the jury.\r\n\r\nPursuant to section 36 of the Criminal Justice Act 1972, the Attorney General referred two questions of law to the Court of Appeal said to have arisen from the trial.\r\n\r\nThe first question related to the lawful excuse defence, which applies where a defendant honestly believes the owner had given their consent, or would have consented had they “known of the destruction or damage and its circumstances”.  On this point, the Court of Appeal confirmed that \"\"circumstances\"\" do not include the merits, urgency or importance of the matter about which the defendant is protesting, nor the perceived need to draw attention to a cause or situation.\r\nThe second question related to whether the judge was right to rule that the defence should not be withdrawn from the jury. The Court of Appeal declined to answer, as that may call into question the acquittal. However it did address the legal question as whether and when it is appropriate not to leave a possible defence to the jury (see judgment, paragraphs 52 to 64).",

Friends of the Irish Environment is challenging the 2023 Climate Action Plan and its corresponding Annex of Actions, on the grounds that the Plan does not comply with the requirements of sections 4(2)(a), 4(2)(b) and 4(3) of the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015 (as amended).\r\n\r\nFriends of the Irish Environment has laid out the following submissions: \r\n\r\n1. The State has not “ensured” that the Plan is “consistent” with the Carbon Budget Programme contrary to the requirements of section 4(2)(a) of the 2015 Act.\r\n\r\n2 The Plan does not contain a roadmap of actions that include the sector specific actions “that are required to comply with the carbon budget and sectoral emissions ceiling for the period to which the plan relates” (section 4(2)(b)(i) of the 2015 Act) or “that are required to address any failure or projected failure, to comply with the carbon budget and sectoral emissions ceiling for the period to which the plan relates” ((section 4(2)(b)(ii) of the 2015 Act).\r\n\r\n3, The Plan's Annex of Actions does not specify measures that will “in the Minister’s opinion, will be required for the first budget period in a carbon budget programme” for the purposes of section 4(3)(a) of the 2015 Act or the policies identified in 4(3)(b) of the 2015 Act.\r\n\r\nThe focus of the case is on ensuring that the Climate Action Plan 2023 and its Annex of Actions is consistent with Ireland’s obligations under the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015 (as amended); that it includes quantification of the emissions reductions expected from the Plan and adopts any further measures necessary to comply with the 2021-2025 carbon budget.\r\n\r\nOn 7 Feb 2025, the High Court determined that the Applicant had not provided sufficient evidence to demonstrate that the Plan was inconsistent with the carbon budget.

      "summary": "The present case is a writ Petition was filed to the Supreme Court of India, invoking its jurisdiction and to issue the necessary order to protect two endangered birds, the Great Indian Bustard (GIB) and Lesser Florican. This petition was in reference the judgment of the Supreme Court dated 19th April, 2021 wherein the Supreme Court had ordered that a large part of the territory not be used for overhead transmission lines, gave instructions to convert to underground power lines within a year and appointed a committee to determine whether laying high voltage underground power lines would be feasible. The Ministry of Environment, Forests, and Climate Change, the Ministry of Power, and the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (‘MNRE’) requested a modification of the judgement dated 19th April, 2021, on the grounds that the implementation of the said judgment would cause adverse implications for the power sector and India’s International commitment for energy transition and fulfilment of promise under the Paris agreement signed by India in 2015 under the United Nations Framework Conventions on Climate Change[UNFCC]. In the present case the Apex Court had to decide two major issues i.e. modification of the directions issued under the earlier judgment dated 19th April, 2019 and to balance the preservation of Great Indian Bustard and India’s commitment to control climate change through just transition [ shifting from energy from fossil fuels to renewable energy]. The Apex court reviewed the factors causing threats to Great Indian Bustards, the actions taken by the Government of India, specifically the programme ‘Habitat Improvement and Conservation breeding of Great Indian Bustard’ launched in 2016 and other measures. The Court also discussed the impacts of changing climate and India’s commitments and efforts to control it. It was observed that promotion of renewable energy sources is crucial for promoting social equity by ensuring access to clean and affordable energy for all segments of society and thus fostering inclusive growth and development across the nation. The Court emphasised on the duty on the part of the State under Article 48 A and fundamental duty of citizens under Article 51 A of the constitution of India as constitutional commitments to ensure protection of natural world and compassion for living creatures. Relating these duties to Articles 21 and 14 of the Indian Constitution, the Court declared that the right to clean environment and right against the adverse effects of climate change has its source in Article 21 which recognises the right to life and personal liberty and article 14 which indicates equality before law and equal protection of law. Thus, justifying the actions of the State, the court dealt with intersection between climate change and human rights as well as a novel issue of intricate interface between the conservation of an endangered species, such as the Great Indian Bustard and the imperative of protecting against the climate change.\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court noted the need to balance the interests of conserving the GIB with India's commitment to reduce emissions and move away from fossil fuel-based energy resources. By an order dated 21 March 2024, the SC restricted the undergrounding requirement under the 2021 Order to only the priority GIB areas (approximately 13,163 square kilometers), subject to feasibility to be determined by an expanded seven-member expert committee. The Supreme Courtalso modified the 2021 Order by easing the restrictions imposed by the 2021 Order in the potential GIB areas",

      "type": "case",
      "count": 1,
      "summary": "On January 11, 2024, Greenpeace Netherlands and eight Dutch citizens of the island of Bonaire sued the Dutch State about the lack of climate adaptation and mitigation action. The plaintiffs argue that the Dutch State has not taken sufficient climate adaptation and mitigation measures to protect the people of Bonaire, a small Dutch island in the Caribbean near Venezuela, against the negative effects of climate change on human rights, in line with the 1,5⁰C goal of the Paris Agreement and human rights treaties. The complaint was launched after plaintiffs issued a warning letter in 2023, demanding to meet with Ministries in The Hague to have talks about better climate adaptation policy and action for the island, as well as more resources devoted to adaptation.\r\n\r\nIn terms of legal bases, the plaintiffs argue that the Dutch State is committing an ‘unlawful act’ (onrechtmatige daad) under Article 6:162 of the Civil Code by failing to implement adequate climate adaptation and mitigation action, in a way that protects inhabitants’ international human rights. The case follows the legal reasoning by the Dutch Supreme Court in the landmark Urgenda-case, as well as in judgement of the Dutch District Court in the Hague in the Shell-case. The rights at stake in the present case include the right to life and right to private life, family and the home in Articles 2 and 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR), the prohibition of discrimination in Article 14 of the ECHR and the right to culture of people living on the Caribbean island under Article 27 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). In support, plaintiffs also invoke several provisions of the Aarhus Convention on Access to Information, Public Participation and Access to Justice in Environmental Matters on relevant procedural rights and obligations, e.g. Articles 5, 6 and 7 of the Aarhus Convention.\r\n\r\nRegarding the right to culture and non-discrimination under Article 27, plaintiffs explain that the inhabitants of Bonaire are a minority within the Kingdom of the Netherlands, with a special and deeply rooted shared culture and history tied to their island. The complaint provides ample detail on the colonial history of the islands, the culture of the island and its inhabitants, as well as its current legal status as a ‘special’ municipality of the European part of the Netherlands. The plaintiffs claim that as inhabitants of Bonaire, they are not treated the same as Dutch citizens living in the European part of the Netherlands, because for ‘European Netherlands’ major adaptation works have long been planned and undertaken, resources reserved and devoted, as well as permanent, ongoing evaluations and assessments of the situation. There is no comparable protection for Bonaire. In fact, plaintiffs argue that in light of the deep structural inequality between the quality of life on Bonaire (i.e. very high levels of poverty) and those living in the European part of the Netherlands, there is reason to argue that the State should pay extra attention to the situation on Bonaire. They argue that this also follows from case law under Article 14 ECHR, and the principle of equality under Article 1 of the Dutch constitution.\r\n\r\nRegarding Articles 2 and 8 ECHR and mitigation, the plaintiffs build on the legal reasoning previously endorsed by the Dutch Supreme Court in the Urgenda-case. Notably, Article 2 and 8 ECHR entail positive legal obligations for the Dutch State to do its ‘fair share’ to prevent dangerous climate change by adequately mitigating GHG emissions. The plaintiffs argue that based on the Netherlands’ historical emissions, compared to other countries, especially in the developing world, it is no longer fair for the Netherlands to still emit any GHGs. They also refer to studies indicating that it is feasible for the Netherlands to achieve net-zero emissions in the Netherlands by 2040, rather than 2050. As such, this is what the plaintiffs consider legally necessary for the Netherlands to do as its minimum ‘fair share’ to prevent dangerous climate change. According to the plaintiffs, the negative effects on the lives of people on Bonaire are already significant and will only increase if no action is taken. Climate change threatens, among other things, their lives, their livelihoods, their health, their cultural heritage, nature, and the possibility for future generations to live on in the same way on Bonaire.\r\n\r\nThe plaintiffs extend their legal reasoning on mitigation also to adaptation. They note that there is ‘widespread consensus’ in international climate policy and law, as well as amongst human rights bodies, that there is a need to ‘rapidly accelerate’ the implementation of adaptation measures. Plaintiffs argue that the State has a legal obligation to take all appropriate measures that may be reasonably necessary, in a timely and consistent manner. This obligation is based on due diligence, and must take into account the special needs and disproportionate vulnerability of the inhabitants of Bonaire, and the complex historical and political context of the islands. They also point to other successful climate litigation on adaptation in this regard, such as the Torres Straight Islanders case at the UN Human Rights Committee.\r\n\r\nOn September 25, 2024, the District Court in The Hague rendered an interim judgment on the admissibility of the parties. It decided that Greenpeace as an environmental NGO acting on behalf of the interests of all people on Bonaire is admissible. The 8 individual citizens' case  were not. Greenpeace is admissible based on Article 3:305a of the Civil Code, which provides for special standing for NGOs to take collective action. The Court did not consider the 8 individual admissible under the same procedure, because Greenpeace's claim already incorporates theirs as well; the citizens are not allowed to bring a claim of behalf of other residents on Bonaire in a similar way as Greenpeace; and the citizens did not sufficiently provide evidence of being 'personally directly affected' by climate change either, possibly justifying a seperate claim on their own behalf. \r\n\r\nGreenpeace Netherlands, along with legal teams from Kennedy Van der Laan and Prakken d’Oliveira Human Rights Lawyers, will continue to push for faster CO2 reductions and improved adaptation measures to protect Bonaire from the climate crisis. The first hearing is expected in 2025, with the State’s substantive defense to be presented later in 2025. In February 2025, Greenpeace released its final written response in this case. ",

Shell), international climate science (IPCC, IEA), and soft law instruments (UNGPs, OECD Guidelines), the claimant argues that ING’s failure to adopt effective emissions reduction policies constitutes a tortious act.\r\n\r\nThe summons outlines that ING’s role as a financial enabler of fossil fuel expansion and other high-emission sectors results in both direct and facilitated emissions (scope 3), which ING fails to adequately report or reduce. The case relies heavily on the endangerment doctrine, highlighting ING’s long-term knowledge of climate risks, its capacity to act, and the severe, foreseeable harm resulting from inaction.\r\n\r\nMilieudefensie asks the court to compel ING to take the following actions:\r\n\t1.\tHalve its total emissions by 2030, and continue reducing thereafter, in line with the IPCC’s 1.5°C pathway.\r\n\t2.\tReduce emissions in eight major sectors it finances (e.g., steel, aviation) in line with the International Energy Agency’s Net Zero Emissions (NZE) scenario.\r\n\t3.\tCease all financing and investment in companies starting new oil and gas projects.\r\n\t4.\tRequire all large corporate clients to submit credible, science-based climate plans, aligned with the OECD Guidelines and UNGPs.\r\n\r\nThese demands are grounded in Milieudefensie’s argument that absolute emissions reductions (not merely intensity reductions) are essential to fulfilling ING’s legal and human rights obligations.\r\n\r\nThe summons provides a comprehensive scientific basis, citing the IPCC’s Sixth Assessment Report and carbon budget data, which indicate that global CO₂ emissions must fall by at least 48% by 2030 and reach net-zero by 2050 to preserve a 50% chance of staying within 1.5°C warming.\r\n\r\nMilieudefensie also invokes human rights law, emphasizing ING’s responsibility to protect rights to life, health, and a clean and sustainable environment under the ECHR and other international norms. The summons references the KlimaSeniorinnen v. Switzerland judgment, reinforcing that actors cannot evade climate responsibility by pointing to others.\r\n\r\nMilieudefensie claims that ING’s “Terra approach” and other existing policies are inadequate because:\r\n\t•\tThey rely primarily on intensity targets instead of absolute reductions;\r\n\t•\tThey exclude 70% of ING’s financed emissions and all facilitated emissions;\r\n\t•\tING continues to support fossil fuel companies, including those expanding oil and gas production;\r\n\t•\tING lacks sector-specific targets in high-emission areas beyond upstream oil and gas;\r\n\t•\tExecutive remuneration is not linked to emissions reductions;\r\n\t•\tING’s engagement policy prioritizes financial risk over climate harm.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Banking on Climate Chaos report, ING ranks among the top 30 fossil fuel financiers globally, having facilitated over €106 billion in fossil fuel investments since the Paris Agreement.\r\n\r\nAnticipating ING’s likely “effectiveness” defence, Milieudefensie argues that requiring ING to act would have a direct and indirect impact on global emissions. Citing legal precedents (Urgenda, Shell, KlimaSeniorinnen, Brussels Court of Appeal, Montana case), it affirms that partial responsibility is sufficient for tortious liability and that holding ING accountable can have a systemic, flywheel effect on the market and policy landscape.",

The plaintiffs are 66 and 63 years old respectively and are campesinos that were forced to leave their land where they lived and worked, because of the 2015 and 2016 floodings of the river Bojabá. Since then, the plaintiffs have not been able to return.\r\n\r\nDue to the dire situation of Colombia’s internal forced displacement in the context of the armed conflict, in 2011 the Congress issued Law 1448 to provide assistance to all victims of forced displacement. Among the provisions, the Law establishes a series of benefits and programs to aid victims in relocating. The plaintiffs argued that they must be accorded victim status even if their displacement was induced by natural disasters and not the armed conflict. The plaintiffs consider that both victims of forced displacement by natural disasters and armed conflict are in a special vulnerable situation and should be treated equally. The plaintiffs sought to invoke their rights to housing, work, food security, and minimum wage, as well as life and personal safety. \r\n\r\nOn April 16, 2024, the Constitutional Court conducted judicial review and decided that environment and climate-induced migration is indeed a cause of internal forced displacement. The Court found that the plaintiffs had left their houses due to a natural disaster and as such, are subject to a special protection by the Colombian government. However, the Court stated that this status is not covered by existing laws, including Law 1448 of 2011, since these provisions concern victims of displacement due to the armed conflict. As a result, the Court found that there is a legal vacuum when it comes to the special protection of environment and climate-induced forced displacement and ordered the Congress to issue the necessary legislation to fill it. \r\n\r\nThat being said, the Court further concluded that the lack of specific provisions is no excuse for environmental authorities to provide the necessary protection to victims of environment and climate-induced migration in accordance with constitutional and international standards on forced migration. Despite the lack of specific regulation, the Court said that environmental authorities must guarantee victims’ rights and provide attention and assistance that goes beyond the immediate consequences of the forced displacement and aims towards stabilizing the victims’ situation.",

      "summary": "On May 21, 2024, the NGOs BLOOM, Alliance Santé Planétaire, Nuestro Futuro, and eight individuals filed a criminal complaint in Paris Criminal Court against the board of directors and main shareholders of TotalEnergies. According to the plaintiffs' press release, the complaint alleges that the board of directors and main shareholders should be held criminally liable for their decisions that contributed to climate change, which they took despite knowing they would cause significant casualties and environmental damage. The alleged offences include deliberately endangering the lives of others, involuntary manslaughter, neglecting to address a disaster, and damaging biodiversity. According to the press release, the public prosecutor has discretion to decide whether to dismiss the case or open a judicial investigation.\r\n\r\nOn February 7, 2025, the French public prosecutor dismissed the complaint due to a lack of sufficiently established offenses.\r\n\r\nRegarding the offense of endangerment, the prosecutor emphasized that criminal liability requires proof of a deliberate violation of a specific legal or regulatory safety obligation. BLOOM cited various legal texts, including Article 2 of the Paris Agreement (which aims to limit global temperature rise below 2°C), Article 4 of EU Regulation 2021/1119 (which establishes the framework for achieving climate neutrality), and Article L100-4 of the French Energy Code (which mandates a 40% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2050). However, the prosecutor determined that these provisions represent objectives rather than legally enforceable obligations under criminal law. Additionally, the Prosecutor stated that while greenhouse gas emissions are a recognized driver of climate change, such activities are not inherently unlawful. Establishing an environmental offense would require demonstrating a direct causal link between a wrongful act and specific environmental harm, a standard that, according to the prosecutor, was not met in this case.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the prosecutor noted that the offense of willful failure to combat a disaster requires clear knowledge of an ongoing disaster, its precise identification, and an intentional decision not to intervene. The evidence presented did not establish that TotalEnergies deliberately failed to address the natural disasters referenced in the complaint, such as floods, wildfires, storms, and cyclones.\r\n\r\nLastly, regarding involuntary manslaughter, the prosecutor stated that the complexity and multiplicity of factors contributing to severe climate events make it impossible to prove a direct causal link between TotalEnergies' activities and any specific fatality resulting from a climate disaster.",

The organization argues that the environmental impact assessment (EIA) on which the decision was based is inadequate. In April 2024, WWF notified the government of its intention to sue if the decision was not reversed. WWF maintains that the EIA does not meet the minimum requirements set out in the Norwegian Subsea Minerals Act §2-2. The organization also points out that the Norwegian Environment Directorate has expressed similar concerns. WWF further argues that the EIA shows that the Norwegian government does not have sufficient knowledge to assess the environmental impacts of seabed mining. Without this knowledge, it is impossible to properly assess the consequences of exploration and extraction activities. WWF's lawsuit aims to prevent the Norwegian government from violating the law by opening up a new and potentially destructive industry without adequately assessing the consequences. The organization believes that this would set a dangerous precedent and could lead to irreversible environmental damage. Several Norwegian political parties, including the Socialist Left Party, the Liberal Party, the Red Party, the Green Party, and the Christian People's Party, voted against the decision to open up the seabed for mining. These parties share WWF's concerns about the inadequacy of the EIA and the potential environmental risks of seabed mining.

      "summary": "In 2020, BirdLife Estonia (Estonian Ornithological Society) filed a claim to the Tallinn Administrative Court, seeking to annul a 30-year permit for extracting peat that the Environmental Board had recently issued to OÜ Hiiu Turvas. The extraction site (Elbu V) is a habitat for the European golden plover (Pluvialis apricaria) and dunlin (Calidris alpina schinzii), both of whom are endangered species, and destroying the raised bog would also harm other species. According to the EU bird directive (2009/147/EC), the state must employ special measures for the protection of these two species. Furthermore, the site includes a priority habitat as defined by the EU nature directive (92/43/EEC) whose condition in Estonia is unfavourable. Before issuing the permit, the Environmental Board did not assess the extent to which peat extraction would damage this habitat nor its impact on the status of this type of habitat in Estonia. \r\n\r\nThe Tallinn Administrative Court and Tallinn Circuit Court did not satisfy the claim nor the appeal. \r\n\r\nIn March 2024, the Supreme Court of Estonia satisfied the claim and annulled the peat extraction permit. The Court ruled that by destroying a raised bog – that is a natural habitat and the most important type of land carbon sink – and causing carbon emissions, peat extraction causes notable environmental nuisances. Avoiding these impacts was to be considered a national interest in the meaning of the Earth’s Crust Act. These nuisances could only be allowed in case they are proportional to the benefit received from peat extraction. \r\n\r\nThe Court emphasised that when issuing a permit, the Board must take into account the targets set out in strategic development documents. In this case, the Court found that the Board should have assessed the impact of peat extraction on targets to increase carbon storage in bogs that are to be achieved primarily by restoring degraded wetlands and avoiding further draining bogs. The Board had also ignored targets to improve the status of raised bogs as habitats and to ensure the protection of all naturally occurring species in Estonia. These targets are an expression of the principles of sustainable use of natural resources and sustainable development that are stipulated in paragraphs 5 and 53 of the Estonian Constitution. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, the Court explained the grounds for refusal of the permit set out in § 52 (1) (7) of the Environmental Code Act, according to which the Board must refuse the permit if in the course of the proposed activity, natural resources would clearly be used impractically. The Court stated that in the assessment of the practicality of the use of natural resources, the Board must not only consider whether the extracted resource has some kind of practical purpose (e.g. extracted peat can be used in agriculture), but whether the use of the resource as a whole, including the degradation of a natural ecosystem that provides many ecosystem services (including carbon capture and storage), is not wasteful. \r\n\r\nThe Court also ruled that the destruction of such a raised bog that is not under protection and where no protected species or habitats are found can still be considered a significant environmental nuisance that must be avoided according to the General Part of the Environmental Code Act. The Board had not determined whether destroying the habitat by peat extraction constitutes a significant environmental nuisance that must be avoided.",

      "summary": "In November 2022, Greenpeace France published a report named “‘TotalEnergies' carbon footprint: accounts are not good”. In this report, Greenpeace France accused the French oil company TotalEnergies of under-reporting emissions in 2019. While TotalEnergies declared 455 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2019 in its carbon balance, Greenpeace France believed TotalEnergies' core activities had generated around 1.64 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent.\r\n\r\nOn April 28, 2023, TotalEnergies filed a lawsuit against Greenpeace France for violating Article L. 465-3-2 of the Monetary and Financial Code, which prohibits any person from disseminating false or misleading information about a listed company. TotalEnergies argued that Greenpeace France disseminated false and misleading information on its carbon footprint, which was allegedly prejudicial to the Company as a listed company. TotalEnergies asked the civil judge to force Greenpeace France to remove the report from its website and any other medium and to cease all communication relating to it, under a fine of 2,000 euros per day. TotalEnergies also requested for compensation for its damage 1 symbolic euro. \r\n\r\nOn March 28, 2024, the Paris Judicial Court dismissed TotalEnergies' SLAPP against Greenpeace France, declaring it \"null\".  \r\n\r\n- The Court deemed the summons too vague to allow Greenpeace France to effectively defend itself on the merits. Under Article 54 of the Code of Civil Procedure, a summons drafted in vague terms and failing to identify the alleged faults is null to the extent that the defendant is unable to grasp the object of the claims against them and thus defend themselves effectively. Additionally, the summons must be sufficiently precise, without the defendant having to \"search through the documents\" for the exact nature of the grievances against them. The Court decided that no clarification is provided by TotalEnergies regarding the definition of “other false and misleading information”. In addition, the Court considered that TotalEnergies merely highlighted some of the \"multiple\" errors allegedly committed by Greenpeace France: these \"faults\" are formulated in vague terms, while repeatedly indicating that the \"false or misleading information\" identified is not exhaustive. The Court declared that the imprecision of the summons not only concerns the targeted information but also the platforms through which they were disseminated. As a result, the judge declared the nullity of the summons issued by TotalEnergies.\r\n\r\n- Furthermore, the Court ordered TotalEnergies to pay 15,000 euros to Greenpeace France for costs incurred for the procedure (article 700 of the Code of Civil Procedure).",

This lawsuit is part of a set of 6 environmental class actions filed against the 4th Bid Cycle for oil exploration blocks. The aim is to challenge the auction of oil exploration blocks located in the Amazon Basin. \r\n\r\nThe plaintiff argued that the inclusion of this set of blocks is illegal as it overlaps with Conservation Units (Brazilian Protected areas), buffer zones, environmental protection areas and areas where endangered species occur. The plaintiff argued that the climate emergency scenario requires an energy transition towards clean energies and a reduction in GHG emissions, which is incompatible with the expansion of oil exploration. As a preliminary injunction, it requested that the offer in the 4th Permanent Offer Cycle of the blocks in the Amazon Basin in Sector AM-T-82 be suspended until the technical analysis that demonstrates the socio-environmental viability is carried out, in particular with reasoned opinions from bodies such IBAMA. On a definitive basis, they request that the contested blocks be excluded from the Bid Cycle. \r\n\r\nIn March 2024, IBAMA and ANP presented their defenses, stating that the alleged overlapping of an exploration block with Conservation Units does not mean that it should be excluded from the bidding phase, in accordance with current regulations, but that sensitive areas are observed in the procedure. They emphasized the economic benefits of oil exploration for Brazilian society and that in the International Energy Agency's NetZero 2050 scenario, the energy matrix will still rely on oil and natural gas as primary energy and that the impacts of greenhouse gas emissions from the projects can be assessed in the environmental licensing phase under the financial burden of the entrepreneur. The ANP clarified that it promotes social participation before bidding for oil and natural gas exploration rights. They emphasized that simply holding an auction process does not impose a risk on the environment. \r\n\r\nOn March 1, 2024, the Federal Government filed its defense. In addition to addressing the licensing issues already dealt with by other federal bodies, it claimed that the offer of the contested blocks is technically supported by the rules issued by the competent bodies. In March 2024, Atem Participações S.A. filed a defense in which it stressed that the bidding process does not pose a risk to the environment and that all the impacts of the projects to be explored will be assessed during the environmental licensing phase.",

This lawsuit is part of a set of 6 environmental class actions filed against the 4th Bid Cycle for oil exploration blocks. The aim is to challenge the auction of oil exploration blocks located in the Potiguar Basin. \r\n\r\nThe plaintiff argued that the inclusion of this set of blocks is illegal because (i) the blocks overlap with seamount areas, which are extremely important geological formations for the region's ecosystem; (ii) there was a lack of a technical analysis of the feasibility of the offer or environmental assessment studies; (iii) the exploration areas are located less than 100km from the coast; and (iv) they imply investment to explore for oil and gas in a region of rich biodiversity and tourism, in a climate emergency scenario. The plaintiff argued that this scenario requires an energy transition towards clean energies and a reduction in GHG emissions, which is incompatible with the expansion of oil exploration. As a preliminary injunction, it requested that the offer in the 4th Permanent Offer Cycle of the blocks in the Potiguar Basin in Sector SPOT-AP2 be suspended until the technical analysis that demonstrates the socio-environmental viability is carried out, in particular with reasoned opinions from bodies such as ICMBio and IBAMA. On a definitive basis, they request that the contested blocks be excluded from the Bid Cycle. \r\n\r\nIBAMA, ICMBio and the Federal Government presented their defenses based on procedural arguments, such as plaintiff's illegitimacy, the absence of environmental damage resulting from the auction and the regularity of the procedure offering the area by the ANP.

      "summary": "This is a Public Civil Action (ACP) with a request for an injunction filed by the Brazilian Institute for the Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (IBAMA) on October 30th, against the Municipality of Pitimbu and private individuals due to the irregular construction of eleven properties in a permanent preservation area (APP), located on the banks of the Acaú River and in a mangrove swamp. The plaintiff argued the aggravating factor of the lack of infrastructure in the properties, which dump waste and sewage into the mangroves and the river, causing pollution and degradation to the environment. In addition, the lawsuit points to the omission of the Municipality of Pitimbu, which has never tried to effectively prevent this problem and act to preserve and defend the environment. It alleges that the municipality is neglecting its responsibility to monitor and enforce compliance with environmental regulations in urban areas by ignoring the rampant exploitation in the region. It therefore requested, as an injunction, that the individual defendants refrain from building, renovating, expanding or carrying out any act that modifies the current state of their properties, as well as that the Municipality monitor compliance with the injunction. On the merits, it requested that the 11 properties be demolished and that the defendants be ordered to repair, correct or compensate for the environmental damage caused. \r\n\r\nAt first, the injunction was granted. Subsequently, a sentence was handed down, recognizing that the properties are located in a place prohibited by environmental legislation on the banks of the river, encroaching on APP. It was also identified that the properties cause environmental pollution. However, the Court concluded that environmental protection was not the only value at stake, indicating that the occupation of the Acaú River was long-standing, and was made up mostly of low- to very low-income families. The Court considered that it could not grant the claim in full in order to avoid greater social damage - loss of housing. However, given the evident responsibility of the residents for the irregular occupation and the discharge of sewage into the river, it deemed appropriate to make the measures granted as a precautionary measure definitive, partially upholding the claim. \r\n\r\nIBAMA was dissatisfied with the ruling and filed an appeal claiming that the right to housing cannot be exercised in an absolute manner, but must respect the environmental rules that prevent construction in permanent preservation areas, such as a mangrove swamp. The Appeal was dismissed and IBAMA then filed a Special Appeal against the ruling. On May 9, 2019, a ruling was then handed down by the Brazilian High Court (STJ), in a Special Appeal, which upheld IBAMA's appeal. The ruling emphasized that the legislator conferred an absolute presumption of untouchability on permanent preservation areas. In addition, it drew attention to the fact that, with the ever-increasing impact of climate change on our planet, water crises are intensifying, so these protections are even more important, and illegal occupation or exploitation of springs and the banks of watercourses, lakes and lagoons cannot be allowed as if they were necessary sacrifices to solve the housing shortage. It stated that any private or state action, including judicial action, must take into account scientific knowledge about climate change and the risks associated with it, worrying about climate integrity. It also stated that, for those in need who had built strictly residential houses before IBAMA's notice, it will be up to the omission municipality to provide them with material support, including by means of \"social rent\" and priority in housing programs, but this duty is neither a condition nor an impediment to the immediate execution of the court order to remove the illegitimate constructions. In its ruling the omission and negligence of the Municipality of Pitimbu was also recognized, identifying its responsibility for joint and several liability and subsidiary enforcement.",

After around 5 hours, the bank filed a criminal complaint and asked the police to clear the occupation. An hour later, the police asked activists to leave and began clearing the occupation 15 minutes later by kettling the remaining protestors. The police issued 60 penal orders, and subjected 37 people to identification measures (including taking DNA samples), and arrested 40 people who spent up to 2 days in prison. \r\n\r\nThe penal orders accused activists of criminal damage (art. 144 Swiss Criminal Code, CC), coercion (art. 181 CC), unlawful entry (art. 186 CC), rioting (art. 260) and transgression of cantonal regulations (art. 16, UeStG BS). The sanctions amounted to 180 daily penalty unites (Tagessätze) with a suspension period of 3 years, plus fines (Busse). At least 5 people filed a rejection of the penal order and appeared in court. Ahead of the trial, UBS withdrew its criminal complaints and reached a settlement with the activists. However, the public prosecutor insisted on proceeding with the trial. \r\n\r\nThe court acquitted the defendants (rejecting the main charge of coercion) and the prosecutor did not appeal against the acquittal (due to a lack of appeal, no written judgement was issued). In a separate trial, activists who were subjected to police identification measures (Art. 260 Swiss Criminal Procedure Code, CPC) and non-invasive samples and DNA analysis (Art. 255 CPC) appealed against these measures with the prosecutor who rejected the appeal and subsequently with the court of appeals that also rejected it (Basel-Stadt Appelationsgericht BES.2019.150, March 20, 2020). Activists then appealed to the Federal Supreme Court (Bundesgericht) which accepted the appeal and nullified the police measures of identification and DNA profiling (Bundesgericht 1B_285/2000 - leading case, 1B_286 & 294/2000, 1B_287 & 293/2020, April 22, 2021).

After two days, the police evacuated the remaining approximately 200 people, where around 90 people were arrested for several hours. Around 150 people later received a penal order accusing activists of the prevention of an official act (art. 286 Swiss Criminal Code, CC) and contempt of official orders (art. 292 CC), and around 18 people filed a rejection of penal order to enter criminal trial proceedings. \r\n\r\nWhile the Bern High court rejected a request to join most of the 18 cases into a collective trial, the Regional court (first instance), declared one of the cases a “pilot” trial, and suspended all other cases until the pilot trial was finished. Despite an open appeal at the court of second instance to join the cases, the court of first instance proceeded with the pilot trial and convicted an activist in line with the criminal charges issued with the penal order (RG BE PEN 21 1011, 12.12.2022). The verdict (and the “pilot” nature of the trial) was appealed by the defendant’s lawyer. Whereas the appeal against the verdict was later withdrawn, the appeal against the “pilot” nature of the trial and the suspension of other cases were successful. To the activists, the “pilot trial” poses a risk of prejudicing their individual cases, thereby undermining their due process rights (Art. 6 ECHR). \r\n\r\nThe appeal was upheld by the second instance (OG BE BK 22 396, 15.3.2023). In a somewhat contradictory decision, the court declared the “pilot” nature of the first case void and overturned the suspension of the other cases, while still refusing to join the cases. One of the defendants appealed against this decision to the Federal Supreme Court which rejected the appeal to join the cases (BG 7N_209/2023, October 11, 2023). The defendant may be appealing to the ECtHR. In the meantime, most of the 18 defendants who initially filed a rejection against the penal order have withdrawn the rejection and thus accepted the criminal charges. A few activists decided to go through the courts to contest their penal orders, and if needed, to take their cases to the ECtHR in Strasbourg. The second and third trial also confirmed the charges of the penal order and convicted the defendant (for second trial, see PEN 22 361, 27.11.2023).",

After about 20 minutes, the police issued a warning to all participants occupying the Quaibrücke to leave the bridge. After 40 minutes, the remaining approximately 250 people were kettled and arrested. The public prosecutor's office issued penalty orders for coercion (Art. 181 CC) and disruption of public transport (Art. 239 CC). \r\n\r\nIn October 2021, XR organized another unauthorized demonstration in Zürich under the slogan “Rebellion Against Extinction”. About 180 individuals were arrested throughout a week of protest. Some protestors spent up to two days in jail. Similar to the Quaibrücke action in 2020, the public prosecutor’s office charged all the arrested prosecutors with coercion (Art. 181 CC). More than 30 individuals (collectively in both actions) have objected to their penal orders (some of the activists received a penal order for both actions). Thus far, almost all of them have been tried in the court of first instance (with 7 acquittals) and half of them in the court of second instance (with 3 acquittals). At least 9 individuals have appealed against their convictions to the Federal Supreme Court (court of third instance) and a smaller group plans to appeal further to the European Court of Human Rights (ECtHR) should their conviction be confirmed by the Supreme Court. \r\n\r\nThree interrelated issues became central to both actions and the ensuing criminal proceedings: a) the role of judges as impartial decision-makers, b) the application of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) in cases of unauthorized protests, and c) the question of coercion (Art. 181 CC). Two acquittals in the court of first instance (BzG ZH GB220099, 30.8.2022; GB220026, 31.8.2022) have raised a lot of attention because District Judge Harris announced to judge all future defendants in related climate cases on the basis of case law of the ECtHR that foregrounds freedoms of expression and assembly under Arts. 10 and 11 of the ECHR. \r\n\r\nThe chief prosecutor then filed a request for recusal of the judge which was granted by the Cantonal Court (OG ZH UA220042, 14.11.2022). Two activists who were affected by this recusal appealed against this decision by the Cantonal Court to the Federal Supreme Court. The Federal Supreme Court accepted the appeal of both activists, insofar as it revoked the decision of the Cantonal Court not to grant the accused party status in the recusal proceedings (BG 1B_10/2023, 6.4.2023). The Cantonal Court had to review its decision to recuse Judge Harris once again and confirmed its initial decision. Meanwhile, the Cantonal Court accepted the prosecution’s appeals and overturned both of Judge Harris’ acquittals (OG ZH SB220594, 11.4.2023; SB220583, 13.4.2023). Eventually, the Federal Supreme Court confirmed the decision to recuse Judge Harris (BG 7B_601/2023, 22.3.2024). \r\n\r\nThis successful case of forced recusal of a judge is the only such request ever that was lodged by prosecution to dismiss an allegedly biased judge in the context of Swiss climate trials. There appears to be no successful case of recusal of a judge despite several such requests lodged by the defense. Throughout all proceedings and court instances in both cases, judges had to decide if the charge of coercion was justified and the defendant thus guilty, or if the intensity of coercion was small enough to grant an acquittal, considering the peaceful nature of the protest. When judges did acquit the defendants from the charge of coercion, they did so only if the defendant occupied a public road for a few minutes (low intensity). Only in a few instances have judges acquitted defendants who occupied the road for a longer period: In two cases it was Judge Harris who justified the acquittal with the case law of the ECHR (as above). In another instance, it was a judge in Bern who had to decide over a case where an activist was accused for two different occupations, one in Zürich (RGA) and another in Bern. Here, the Bernese judge dismissed the charge of coercion although it was established that the defendant occupied the road for 1.5 hours (PEN 22 704, 9.3.2023). To the judge, it was unclear who was coerced and how. In Switzerland, the conviction under coercion is usually suspended for 2 years unless the defendant violates the terms. In this case, a conviction under coercion leads to a criminal record. \r\n\r\nWhile appeals by several defendants are pending at the Federal Supreme Court, 5 UN Special Rapporteurs* have positively responded to a separate appeal by the defendants by issuing an official letter to the Swiss government (AL CHE 7/2023, 29.1.2024). In that letter, the Rapporteurs express their concerns over the apparent restrictions of fundamental rights to freedom of expression and peaceful assembly. The Rapporteurs further emphasize that civil disobedience is in line with international law in relation to human rights. The Rapporteurs also express concerns over extended arrests of the activists and an allegedly limited access to legal representation. *David R.

In the meantime, some of the unknown activists revealed their identity and successfully opposed their DNA profiling. In the trials of the activists whose identities were known to the authorities all were acquitted in the first instance of the charge of unlawful entry (the prosecution maintained the charge despite Holcim's withdrawal of the complaint). Most of the activists were also acquitted of the charge of contempt of official orders. Several people were convicted of preventing an official act. The public prosecutor's office has appealed against several acquittals and the Cantonal Court has overturned some of them. While some proceedings are still ongoing, most of them are over and executive judgments vary from acquittals to (suspended) fines and day-fines.",

Two of the activists appealed the judgment and their case was dropped after the plaintiff (Direction générale des immeubles & patrimoine) withdrew the complaint in exchange for reimbursement of the cleaning costs. Another activist, who had filmed the action in Lausanne, did not oppose his conviction but refused to pay his daily penalty units to publicize a sentence he considered disproportionate. Until 2023, he acknowledged letters from the authorities asking him to pay his pecuniary penalty in responding something along these lines: “I will not reply to your letter because I do not wish to cooperate with a system that endangers the population through its inaction in the face of climate change”.

This lawsuit is part of a set of 6 environmental class-actions filed against the 4th Bid Cycle for oil exploration blocks. \r\nThe plaintiffs argue that the inclusion of a set of blocks located in the Mucuri, Potiguar, and Alagoas Basins is illegal, as they overlap with Quilombola’s Lands and Areas of Direct Influence of Quilombola’s Lands and there was no prior, free and informed consultation process. They claim this is a case of environmental racism, since the proximity of the exploration blocks to Quilombola’s Lands poses risks to health, the environment and the use of the territory by the peoples who live there. They state that the climate crisis scenario requires an energy transition towards clean energies and a reduction in GHG emissions, which is incompatible with the expansion of oil exploration. Furthermore, they affirm that Quilombola’s Lands are essential for combating this crisis, as they are barriers against deforestation and forest degradation. \r\n\r\nAs a preliminary injunction, the plaintiffs request the suspension of the offer of the contested exploration blocks in the 4th Bid Cycle until the protection of quilombolas rights is observed. On a definitive basis, they request that the contested blocks be excluded from the Bid Cycle until the affected quilombola people are consulted.",

      "summary": "In May 2024, the Estonian Environmental Board issued an integrated permit to the new state-owned Enefit280-2 shale oil plant, allowing it to operate until the end of 2034. Following the Supreme Court ruling in Fridays for Future Estonia (MTÜ Loodusvõlu) vs. Eesti Energia regarding the construction permit issued to the same plant (https://climatecasechart.com/non-us-case/11477/), Fridays for Future Estonia filed another claim in June 2024 to stop the operation of the plant. \r\n\r\nThere are two claimants in the case: MTÜ Loodusvõlu, the legally registered NGO of Fridays for Future Estonia, and Elo-Lee Maran, a young activist in the movement. The claimants argue that the Environmental Board should have refused to issue an integrated permit to the plant, because operating the plant causes carbon emissions, thereby hindering the achievement of the targets set out in the Paris Agreement and the National Energy and Climate Plan. Estonia has a national emission reduction target set for 2035 and to meet this, the Board issued the permit with a deadline, allowing the plant to operate until the end of 2034. However, the plant would increase Estonia’s yearly greenhouse gas emissions by about 6%, therefore diminishing Estonia’s share of the global carbon budget. The plant’s emissions would also hinder the achievement of the emission reduction target set out in the National Energy and Climate Plan 2030 in 2019, whereby Estonia should reduce its emissions by 70% (or to about 10.5 million tons) by 2030 compared to 1990. Additionally, MTÜ Loodusvõlu claims that the Board should have assessed the cumulative environmental impact of mining oil shale and producing oil from it. Overlooking the cumulative impact on nearby affected Natura 2000 areas constitutes a violation of the EU habitats’ directive. Furthermore, Elo-Lee Maran argues that, by aggravating the climate crisis, the operation of the plant violates her right to a healthy environment, as stipulated in national as well as international law. She also argues that the Environmental Board overlooked its obligation, stemming from the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, to set her best interests first when deciding on the permit. The Board did not pay any attention to the fact that worsening the consequences of climate change and depleting the ever-smaller carbon budget, which would require Estonia to limit people’s basic freedoms intensely in the future to limit climate change, are not in the best interests of a child. \r\n\r\nPromptly after filing the case, the Tallinn Administrative Court accepted the case and applied temporary interim protection, forbidding Enefit Power AS from beginning the operation of the plant until July 12th, 2024. On July 12th, the court refused a motion for further interim protection. The Court also ordered the Environmental Board to respond to the case by the beginning of August 2024.",

      "summary": "On July 24, 2023, a group of citizen members of two NGOs (Dejusticia and Ilex Acción Jurídica) filed a lawsuit against Article 57 of Law 99 of 1993. The article establishes the\r\ndefinition and criteria of environmental impact assessments (EIA) in Colombia, which includes biotic, abiotic, and socioeconomic elements. Plaintiffs argue that, as it stands, this norm does not abide by the constitutional and international human rights standards, given the lack of consideration of climate change and human rights. Plaintiffs assert that even though climate\r\nchange-related standards only appeared after the law was issued, failing to update the interpretation of this legal provision results in unconstitutional restrictions and interpretation\r\nissues that prevent EIA from complying with international commitments that have been ratified by Colombia and are part of the constitutional bloc.\r\n\r\nThe plaintiffs are not asking the Court to declare the unconstitutionality of the article since this would create a legal vacuum that could eventually derive in more significant violations of\r\nconstitutional rights. Instead, the plaintiffs asked the Court to order that the provision should be interpreted as to include climate change and human rights protection as part of the criteria to be considered when conducting an EIA. In so doing, the legal provision is updated to comply with the currently admissible constitutional standard, while its interpretation is clarified, avoiding unconstitutional applications.\r\n\r\nThe plaintiffs’ arguments were twofold: first, article 57 incurs in a lack of constitutional protection, violating articles 2, 79, 80, and 93.1 of the Colombian Constitution, as well as articles\r\n1.1 and 2 of the American Convention on Human Rights, by failing to include impacts associated to climate change in the EIA criteria. Second, article 57 violates articles 7, 20, 74, 79, 80 and 334 of the Colombian Constitution, as well as articles 4.1, 5.1 and 13 of the American Convention on Human Rights by failing to include human rights violations in the EIA criteria. The plaintiffs claim that human rights and the environment are interconnected and that this should be reflected in the laws governing EIAs.\r\n\r\nOn January 12, 2024, the Constitutional Court declared the admissibility of the lawsuit, but only regarding the first argument supported in the alleged violation of articles 79 and 80 of the\r\nColombian Constitution. The arguments related to the violation of the legal provisions of the American Convention on Human Rights were dismissed. The Court also ordered several\r\ngovernmental authorities, including the Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development, as well as NGOs such as Greenpeace Colombia, the Colombian Association of Oil and Gas, and others to provide written comments on the impacts of climate change in the interpretation of the right to a healthy environment and article 57 of Law 99 of 1993.\r\n\r\nOn July 11, 2024, the Constitutional Court found that article 57 of Law 99 of 1993 was constitutional insofar as it is understood that EIAs must include climate change among the evaluation criteria. The Court ordered the Congress to issue the necessary regulations to ensure climate change is considered when conducting activities that require EIA. The Court also ordered the Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development to modify and update EIA's terms of reference. In the Court's opinion, failing to include climate change in EIA processes would amount to a violation of the Colombian Constitution and a failure to guarantee the protection of the right to a healthy environment and sustainable development.",

      "summary": "Beijing Grassland Alliance Environmental Protection Center, supported by three other NGOs, sued Xingyi Shangcheng Power Generation Company Limited. The plaintiff raised eight demands, focusing on three key issues:\r\n1. Environmental damages: The plaintiff accused the defendant of engaging in long-term practices that included emitting waste gas, dust, and key pollutants above standard levels, tampering with or forging pollution monitoring data, and failing to maintain automatic monitoring equipment. The plaintiff argued that these actions constituted an environmental tort and requested the court to hold the defendant accountable for civil liabilities. The plaintiff sought court orders for the cessation of the infringement, the elimination of pollution risks, environmental restoration, compensation for the loss of environmental services, and a public apology.\r\n2. Carbon Emissions: The plaintiff alleged that the defendant exceeded the permissible limits for carbon dioxide emissions. As a result, the plaintiff requested the court to evaluate the atmospheric damage caused by these excessive emissions and demanded that the defendant be held accountable for ecological damage and required to provide compensation.\r\n3. Carbon Quotas: The plaintiff argued that the defendant failed to pay for 821,596 tons of carbon emission quotas during the first compliance period of the carbon trading system, despite exceeding the allowable carbon dioxide emissions. The plaintiff requested that the court order the defendant to pay for 818,148 tons of carbon credits and implement energy-saving measures, pointing out that the defendant had only purchased 3,448 tons as of January 2022.\r\n\r\nThe defendant responded by asserting that their pollutant emissions had never exceeded legal limits and had not caused environmental damage. They also claimed that their failure to purchase additional carbon quotas was not intentional but resulted from confusion about compliance deadlines and financial difficulties. Furthermore, they argued that their actual carbon emissions were significantly lower than the amounts calculated by the government when penalties were imposed, and they requested a review of these administrative penalties. Additionally, the defendant contended that the judiciary lacked jurisdiction over this case, asserting that only administrative liability should apply.\r\n\r\nOn June 7, 2024, the Court rendered its decision. \r\n1. Environmental Tort: The court found that the defendant’s emissions of sulfur dioxide and dust, which exceeded the legal limits, constituted an environmental tort, making them civilly liable. However, since the defendant had rectified the issue before the lawsuit and the environmental damage did not require further restoration, the plaintiff's request to stop the infringement and restore the environment was denied. However, the court awarded the plaintiff 9,400 CNY in compensation for the loss of ecological services.\r\n2. Carbon Emissions and Quotas: The court ruled that the defendant had not exceeded emissions standards for waste gas or nitrogen oxides (except during equipment malfunctions), and that the plaintiff failed to prove that the defendant’s non-payment for additional carbon quotas had caused environmental damage. However, the court underscored the future risks associated with excessive carbon dioxide emissions and stressed the importance of stringent control, even though current Chinese law does not classify carbon dioxide as a pollutant, nor does it have specific emission standards for it. The court affirmed the defendant’s obligation to pay for the extra carbon quotas, noting that this obligation was fulfilled during the litigation process.\r\n3. The court concluded that the defendant’s repeated failure to fulfill its carbon trading obligations, despite multiple reminders, was unlawful and contrary to the goals of mitigating climate change and protecting the legal rights of current and future generations.\r\n\r\nTo sum up:\r\n1. The court ruled that it has jurisdiction over failure to comply with carbon trading obligations.\r\n2. Although Chinese law does not currently classify carbon dioxide as a pollutant, its emissions are still subject to stringent controls, and entities responsible for excess emissions must fulfill their obligations accordingly.

      "summary": "16 young people from Japan nationwide, from Hokkaido to Kyushu, filed a case in the Nagoya District Court against 10 thermal power companies, including JERA Corporation, asking for an injunction against CO2 emissions based on the scientific standards. To ensure the plaintiffs and young people across Japan live tomorrow and, in the future, the defendants, the major Japanese electric power companies must decarbonize by the 2030s at least to limit the rise in average global temperatures to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. This case demands the defendants’ implementation of the emission reductions required by science. As we enter the era of \"global boiling,\" temperature rises are approaching 1.5°C worldwide, including Japan. We have already experienced extreme heat of over 40°C. \r\n\r\nOn July 25, UN Secretary-General António Guterres stated that temperature will continue to rise. He also noted that extreme heat is the new normal, which is increasingly straining economies, increasing inequality, and costing people their lives. He pointed out the anthropogenic climate change caused by the use of fossil fuels as the cause, to call for accelerated emission reductions. The situation requires immediate and decisive action. The CO2 emissions of Japan's power generation sector (390 million tons), including the defendants, equates to 16th place in the global ranking of emissions by country. It is also Japan’s largest emitting sector, accounting for about 40% of Japan's energy-derived CO2 emissions. The International Energy Agency (IEA) and the G7 agreement also demand carbon neutrality of the power sector by 2035. The defendants of 10 companies, Japan's largest thermal power producers including JERA, are responsible for 333 million tons of CO2 emissions (in 2019), equivalent to 33% of Japan's energy-derived CO2 emissions. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) calls for a 48% reduction in CO2 emissions by 2030 and a 65% reduction by 2035 compared to 2019 levels to achieve the 1.5°C target (50% confidence). Avoiding dangerous climate change is the world's greatest common concern, to reduce emission reductions to the levels required by the IPCC. \r\n\r\nLarge emitting companies in Japan, which is a developed country, are also obligated to reduce their emissions to this level. The same should be applied to the defendants, the power generators, as a minimum obligation. However, the 2030 reduction targets proposed by the defendants are not only below the requisite level but are also extremely inadequate in that they continue to use coal-fired power generation and rely on technically unproven technologies such as hydrogen, ammonia co-firing, and CCS, all of which have little effect on emission reduction. Moreover, the defendants have not even set the 2035 target at all except JERA, which has set only a 40% reduction target from 2019 levels. In light of these circumstances, it is nearly impossible to assert that they are developing a plan that aligns with the 1.5°C objective. The plaintiffs filed this case in order to be protected from the even more severe impact of climate change, claiming the court’s order for the defendants to fulfil their legal obligation to reduce their emissions The plaintiffs also expect the defendants to shift to a renewable energy company.\r\n\r\nThe First hearing was held on October 24, 2024, where the ten defendant companies made it clear that they would fight. The next hearing date is set for February 18, 2025.",

      "summary": "The constitutional complaint to the German Federal Constitutional Court challenges the reformed German Federal Climate Protection Act. The NGO \"Deutsche Umwelthilfe\" and 11 other complainants aged 14 to 27 are the plaintiffs. The complainants argue, among other things, that the reform violates the principle of intergenerational freedom (as developed by the FCC in its 2021 Neubauer ruling) and infringes on the right to life and physical integrity. \r\n\r\nThe constitutional complaint is one of three complaints filed by five German environmental organizations together with plaintiffs from all parts of society against the inadequate climate policy of the federal government and, in particular, the new Climate Protection Act (KSG). In addition to Deutsche Umwelthilfe (DUH), Greenpeace, Germanwatch, the German Federation for the Environment and Nature Conservation (BUND), and the Solar Energy Promotion Association of Germany (SFV) have each filed a complaint. \r\n\r\nAlready in 2021, DUH, along with some of the plaintiffs, achieved a landmark ruling in which the Federal Constitutional Court granted constitutional status to the right to climate protection. The core of the reform, against which the constitutional complaint is directed, consists in the fact that the federal government's climate protection measures only need to be measured against a cross-sectoral and multi-year total calculation. The government's actions are now based on a projection to comply with the cross-sectoral summed annual emission totals for only three periods: the period 2021-2030, the period 2031-2040, and the period 2041-2045. Only if the projection data show an exceedance of the summed annual emission totals for the decades 2021-2030 or 2031-2040 for two consecutive years does the federal government have to take additional climate protection measures (§ 8 (1) and (4) KSG). However, adjustments for the decade 2031-2040 are not to be made until after 2030.",

The action is seeking for a declaration of unconstitutionality of provisions in Federal Law No. 14,701/2023, which were previously vetoed by the President of the Republic but later overturned by the National Congress. \r\n\r\nIt is argued that the approved law represents a regression in the fundamental rights of Indigenous peoples, such as the elimination of the right to free, prior, and informed consultation, the original right to their historically occupied territories and collective ownership, and the rights to life and culture. The action contends that the rights of Indigenous peoples have been attacked by parliamentary majorities in opposition to decisions of the Supreme Federal Court, which, in its counter-majoritarian role, safeguards fundamental rights. \r\n\r\nIn September 2023, the Supreme Federal Court concluded the judgment of Extraordinary Appeal (RE) 1,017,365 with recognized general repercussion (Topic 1,031), where the “timeframe thesis” was rejected by a majority of the Court, reaffirming the protection of Indigenous territorial rights and environmental protection in the context of the climate emergency. Subsequently, members of Congress revived, under an expedited regime, legislative bills contrary to the established jurisprudence, including Bill No. 490/2007, which was later approved as Federal Law No. 14,701/2023 and enacted with certain articles vetoed. It is emphasized that Indigenous Lands contribute to climate balance, as they are essential for the protection of biodiversity, forests, and water resources. The approved law, therefore, contains various forms of unconstitutionality and puts environmental assets at risk, with the potential to exacerbate deforestation and the climate emergency. \r\n\r\nThe action requests a preliminary injunction to suspend the effectiveness of the challenged articles of Law No. 14,701/2023. On the merits, the action seeks a ruling in favor of the claims, confirming the preliminary injunctions and declaring the challenged provisions of the law unconstitutional. The action further seeks recognition, per Articles 231 and 232 of the 1988 Federal Constitution, that the territorial rights of Indigenous peoples are fundamental rights and immutable clauses. An incidental request for a preliminary injunction was also submitted, highlighting the increase in violence against Indigenous peoples in territorial disputes following the enactment of Federal Law No. 14,701/2023. The request presents a scenario of territorial rights violations and escalating environmental degradation, and it seeks to suspend the effectiveness of the challenged provisions of the Law. \r\n\r\nThe request for a preliminary injunction was addressed in a joint decision on other related claims. Justice Gilmar Mendes, the reporting judge, identified a conflict between the provisions of Law No. 14,701/2023 and the Supreme Federal Court’s ruling in RE 1,017,365/SC, as well as statements by the Inter-American Court of Human Rights on the matter. He ordered the suspension of all judicial proceedings discussing the constitutionality of the challenged law. He also ordered the notification of all parties in the concentrated control actions under review, as well as the Heads of the Executive and Legislative Branches, the Attorney General's Office, and the Federal Prosecution Office, to present proposals for resolving the disputes through consensual means within 30 days.

The action is seeking for a declaration of unconstitutionality of Articles 4(I), 6, 7, 9, and 10 of Law No. 13,576/2017, which regulates the National Biofuels Policy (RenovaBio) and other provisions. By extension, it seeks a declaration of unconstitutionality of Articles 1 to 8 and 12(IV to VII) of Decree No. 9,888/2019, all articles of National Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas, and Biofuels (ANP) Resolution No. 791/2019, and Articles 6(II to VII), 8(II), 11(§3), and 13 of Normative Ordinance No. 56/GM/MME/2022, which violate the norms outlined in the Federal Constitution, the principles of reasonableness and proportionality, as well as articles of the Paris Agreement, an international human rights treaty with supra legal force. \r\n\r\nThe violation allegedly arises from the discrimination against fossil fuel distributors, as they are the only ones required by the contested norms, individually and under penalty of fines, to purchase CBios (financial obligations) to fulfill the formal duty of proving compliance with the annual mandatory target for reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. This is alleged to create discrimination among agents, violating the polluter-pays principle, the principle of equality, environmental protection, economic order, and consumer protection. This stems from holding only fossil fuel distributors responsible for decarbonizing the entire fossil fuel chain, despite other agents in the chain also emitting, thereby affirming the inefficacy of the program’s model. It is argued that the current RenovaBio model has created an inefficient and asymmetric public policy with severe negative environmental, social, and economic impacts, such as increased fuel prices, inflation, and GHG emissions—resulting from the undisputed increase in fossil fuel consumption—that produce outcomes contrary to the commitments made under the Paris Agreement and in conflict with constitutional principles. \r\n\r\nAs an interim relief, the suspension of the effectiveness of the contested provisions was sought until the action is adjudicated. On the merits, a declaration of unconstitutionality of the contested provisions is requested, with erga omnes effect and retroactive effect (ex tunc), or alternatively, that these normative acts be interpreted in accordance with the Constitution, provided that: (i) the annual and individual mandatory targets are assigned to all agents in the fossil fuel chain, in proportion to their GHG emissions; (ii) the supply of CBios is proportional to the mandatory demand, with penalties for non-compliance with the annual and individual targets prohibited in cases where CBios are unavailable on the market; (iii) an annual and individual mandatory target is established for the production or importation of biofuels; (iv) a transparency system is established to verify the reinvestment in biofuel production from the revenue obtained; and (v) standards of reasonableness and proportionality are met in setting and applying the fines for non-compliance with individual targets, and the provision for suspension of the obligated party’s activities as a sanction for non-compliance with individual targets through the sale of CBios is excluded.

The climate impact of the plan must be considered as a whole, in the sense that the combined result of all the elements that can cause climate damage must be considered. Given that the plan proposed by Samax has a significant effect on the environment of another State, and that it is obvious that this condition has been met, at least in relation to Hungary, it was obligatory to comply with the legal provisions relating to these hypotheses, which was not done in the present case, the failure to comply with each of the legal obligations constituting a ground for the illegality of the Environmental Endorsement No 7/2022 issued by the first defendant.\r\n\r\nOn April 25, 2024, the Cluj Court of Appeal upheld the judgment in this respect. Furthermore, the superior court granted the NGO’s appeal, namely upholding the decision for reasons additional to those given by the trial judge: (1) the environmental endorsement was unlawful in view of the fact that it was based on an environmental report drawn up by a non-accredited entity; (2) the adequate assessment study under the Habitats Directive is a mandatory requirement at the SEA stage.

It is argued that the flooding in the municipalities of the Taquari Valley demonstrates the existence of flawed climate governance whose emergency response and prevention systems are inadequate for crises. In contrast, it is argued that effective management of extreme events requires coordinated action between the different sectoral policies and the federal, state and municipal levels of government intending to prevent new disasters and recover affected areas. Moreover, the predictability of the event and human action are stated as important elements in potentiating the disaster, giving rise to civil liability of the defendants for damages caused, without the possibility of invoking any exclusion of causality. It is mentioned that the action aims to guarantee climate justice, recognizing that extreme weather events have a more severe impact on vulnerable communities, which have contributed less to GHG emissions and have fewer resources to adapt and recover. \r\n\r\nThus, it is stated that mitigation strategies must be implemented simultaneously with climate adaptation measures, a duty expressly established in Article 4 of the National Policy on Climate Change (PNMC). It is argued that only with sustainable urban planning strategies, with the active participation of communities and based on the best techniques, will it be possible to build resilient solutions capable of reducing vulnerabilities to disasters. This requires structural and non-structural measures to control flooding and urban drainage systems, the revision of City Planning, the improvement of warning and hydrological control systems and the training of communities. Considering this panorama, the preliminary injunction requires compliance with a series of immediate measures listed in the initial petition to deal with the crisis. Medium and long-term measures are also listed, which are not exhaustive, to establish initial parameters for a joint solution to the issue with the other defendants. Thus, in the final instance, it is requested (i) that the defendants be ordered, with the active participation of the social groups affected, to draw up a restructuring plan, through incremental, successive and/or simultaneous measures, for the areas affected, with due regard for climate adaptation and resilience; (ii) that the form of participation of the groups affected be established; (iii) that a dynamic be established for monitoring the restructuring plan by a committee with representatives from segments of civil society and the government.",

A footnote at the bottom of the ad stated, “Equinor has been delivering energy solutions to the UK for 40 years, and we are now working to help the UK achieve a smooth energy transition […] we’re producing the oil and gas the UK needs now; and will be powering millions more homes with wind, capturing and storing carbon safely […]. It’s broad energy for a brighter future”. The relevant advertising code stated that unqualified environmental claims could mislead if they omitted significant information. The ad appeared in The Economist magazine, which was read by consumer and business readers, as well as politicians and public policy professionals. The Advertising Standards Authority, therefore, considered members of those groups as the ad’s likely audience. While the ad was not for a directly purchasable product or service, the ASA considered it was likely to raise Equinor’s profile and influence readers’ opinions of Equinor as a brand by increasing awareness of their activities and plans in the UK. However, ads were likely to mislead if they exaggerated the contribution that lower-carbon initiatives played, or would play in the near future, as part of the overall balance of a company's activities when making claims about green initiatives. The claim “Wind, oil, gas, carbon capture” gave equal prominence to each activity. It was likely to be interpreted to mean that carbon capture and energy sourced from windfarms formed a significant proportion of Equinor’s current and near future activities, alongside oil and gas. \r\n\r\nThe ASA considered that further information about the overall proportion of Equinor’s business model, which comprised renewable energy and CCS, should have been included. The omission of this significant information is likely to mislead, in breach of the relevant advertising codes.",

This includes a structured plan to ensure the decommissioning of the fossil fuel-powered thermoelectric sector and adopting a process to rebuild state infrastructure. The causes of action include the catastrophic consequences of the climate crisis experienced by the state; the fact that its fossil fuel-powered thermoelectric sector is one of the least efficient in Brazil, responsible for significant environmental liabilities and a large stock of emissions; and the state’s commitment under the Proclima 2050 program, which falls short of the state's needs in terms of energy transition.

      "summary": "On December 11 and 14, 2020, the petitioners filed an administrative claim against Exempt Resolution No. 524/2020, of October 28, 2020, issued by the Evaluation Commission of the Metropolitan Region (Coeva RM), in accordance with Article 17 No. 8 of Law No. 20.600. The claim is against the approval of the “Cerrillos Data Center,” a Google Chile megaproject involving the establishment of a technological data storage center, which requires a powerful cooling system due to a large number of servers in operation. The claim is based on the project's potential adverse effects on the residents of the Cerrillos commune, particularly regarding the potential impacts on water resource availability and air quality.\r\n\r\nTwo claims were filed against the project's approval before the Second Environmental Court: the first by a group of 14 residents of the Cerrillos commune, and the second by the Cerrillos Municipality. During the process, the Municipality of Cerrillos withdrew its legal action, as did 13 residents. The withdrawal was due to the project's public declaration that it would no longer use water to cool the servers. In February 2022, the company presented a “Modification of the ‘Cerrillos Data Center’ Project” to the Environmental Assessment Service (SEA), which involves replacing the water-based cooling towers with air-cooled condensers, thereby eliminating the use of groundwater from the three wells of the Santiago Central Aquifer over which the company has water rights. The action was continued only by one resident.\r\n\r\nThe ruling of September 26, 2024, by the Second Environmental Court, partially upheld the claim and ordered the Environmental Assessment Service (SEA) to revert the evaluation process of the initiative to incorporate consideration of the effects of climate change in the assessment of the water component. It explains that although the SEA determined that the change in the server cooling system did not necessarily require entry into the Environmental Impact Assessment System (SEIA) before its execution, this determination is not binding for the environmental evaluation of the original project. For this reason, the Tribunal's analysis focused on the effects of water use for cooling and its impact on the water resource.\r\n\r\nThe Tribunal concluded that this evaluation did not adequately exclude significant impacts of the project on the water resource, which, it deemed, goes against the preventive principle and the very purpose of an Environmental Impact Declaration. It also added that the measures established by the General Directorate of Water (DGA) do not replace a proper evaluation of the project in terms of ruling out the absence of adverse effects.\r\n\r\nThe court decision emphasized that, in light of the uncertainties raised by the General Directorate of Water (DGA) in its most recent report, the Environmental Assessment Service (SEA) failed to apply adequate precautionary measures. The court highlighted the need to assess the vulnerability of the aquifer and consider the potential impact of climate change under the most adverse conditions. This evaluation should have considered the extensive scientific literature demonstrating Chile’s significant susceptibility to climate change, particularly in the context of the ongoing mega-drought, which directly impacts water resource availability. The court noted that these factors could significantly affect the outcomes of environmental modeling, influencing both the evaluation of adverse effects on water resources and the appropriateness of the conditions and requirements imposed, as well as the voluntary environmental commitments made by the project. Consequently, the court mandated a reevaluation of the project, incorporating the potential effects of climate change in its environmental assessment.",

The plaintiffs claim that the Finnish government’s inadequate climate policies are not only a breach of the nation’s own laws but also a violation of human rights. The plaintiffs argue that the Government's insufficient climate actions and ignoring the special status of the Sami people in the preparation of policy measures in the land use sector violate the rights guaranteed to the Sami people by the Constitution and outlined in Finland’s 2022 Climate Act, which aims to achieve carbon neutrality by 2035. \r\n\r\nIn January 2025, the Supreme Administrative Court (KHO) of Finland turned down the complaint alleging the government's inaction on climate targets. The court acknowledged the government's consideration of carbon sinks but emphasized the need for time to assess the effectiveness of current policies. As implementing the measures takes time, it is impossible to rule on whether they can be considered insufficient relative to the target set for the burden-sharing sector for 2030 and the climate-neutrality target set for 2035. The court held that the climate report cannot be regarded as violating the law. The court also noted that the complaint could yield a different conclusion at a later date if it were shown that the additional measures were insufficient to meet the binding objectives set forth in the Climate Act.",

      "count": 1,
      "summary": "The case was filed against the decision of “EIA not required” about the oil exploration and extraction project of “HANCERLI-9”. According to the Turkish EIA regulation, some oil projects should get an EIA (Environmental Impact Assessment), while experts should examine others to decide whether an EIA is required. The claimants say that in Diyarbakir, Ergani, Hancerler Village 126 block 1,2,3,4 plots and 127 block 3,4 plots, the decision of “EIA not required” about the exploration and drilling project (Permit No: \"AR/TPO/K/L42-c1,c3,c4) of TPAO (Turkish Petroleum) was unlawful. The claimants refer to several grounds to support their argument.  First, they refer to the seismic tests. When searching for oil, a seismic test is required, in which explosions are used to understand what is underground. The claimants argue that seismic testing destroys wildlife and soil. Second, the substances used in drilling wells when searching for oil are toxic, and the debris carried to the surface contains radioactive minerals and heavy metals. Agricultural areas, as well as underground and surface waters, will be in danger. In addition, toxic liquids coming out of the ground because of the exploration activity will mix with the air, soil, underground water, and other water resources. Heavy metals in the fluids brought to the surface will also negatively affect agricultural and animal husbandry activities. Consequently, human health will also be seriously negatively affected. \r\n\r\nThe claimants argue that the decision issued by the Diyarbakır Governorship not to require an EIA goes against what expert institutions have clearly stated: that there might be a threat to agricultural production and an EIA process should be carried out. The claimants also refer to several legal bases. In the project introduction file, many toxic chemicals are listed for use during the project. However, there is no explanation about how and how much of these chemicals will be used and what types of damage may occur. TPAO established a financial responsibility insurance for potential hazards, which means the abovementioned dangers are probable. Projects that threaten agriculture also threaten food security, a growing issue worldwide. The claimants further assert that houses are very close to the project area. They refer to the conditions in Annex 50, as required by Article 46/3 of the Turkish Petroleum Law Implementation Regulation, stating that the conditions have not been met. Many of the other conditions in Annex 50 have also not been met. Many special permits and planning required by Article 48/2 and Articles 6 and 9, as well as the documents required by Article 24 of the Turkish Petroleum Law, are missing.\r\nRegarding the field of activity, DSI (State Hydraulic Works) stated that the area was surrounded by drilling wells and indicated that water analyses should be conducted. In addition, DSI noted that because the area is an agricultural site, alternative regions should be explored.\r\n\r\nClaimants refer to the National Water Board of Turkey, recently established by the Presidential Decree on November 29, 2023. Considering that the areas have recently been declared an oil exploration and extraction area, water resources are being endangered, and this decree is being violated. In addition, hundreds of mining and oil projects have been launched in the Ergani and Diyarbakir area in recent months, and there is no cumulative impact assessment in the introduction file.  They also assert that in the project area, there are wildlife forms that the Bern Convention of The Council of Europe protects. \r\n\r\nFinally, the claimants argue that the oil exploration and extraction activities are contrary to the global climate goals that Turkey is a party to. They state that the GHG resulting from the use of oil creates a heat-trapping effect in the atmosphere and causes climate change. Turkey, following many international agreements, especially the Paris Climate Agreement, is obliged to limit the temperature increase to 2 degrees and contribute to climate change mitigation. The only way to do this is to reduce carbon emissions or, in other words, to phase out fossil fuels. They also refer to the most recent climate adaptation strategy document of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, namely \"Ecosystem-Based Adaptation Strategy to Climate Change for Anatolian Steppe Ecosystems,\" dated July 6, 2022. The Strategy Document, which covers agriculture, pastures and meadows, inland waters, and forests for the period 2022-2036, aims to:\r\n•        Increase resilience in ecosystems that are and will be negatively affected by climate change, \r\n•        Make rural population resistant to climate with an improved agricultural economy, \r\n•        Increase carbon sink potential.\r\n\r\nThe claimants said the activity would increase global warming by polluting water and agricultural resources and paving the way for fossil fuel use. Therefore, it conflicts with Turkish national plans.\r\nTherefore, a project that bears all the abovementioned risks can’t be exempted from an EIA, and should be annulled altogether, or, at the very least, the decision of “EIA not required” should be overruled.\r\n\r\nOn April 30, 2024, the court appointed an independent expert committee to explore the field and prepare an expert opinion. The committee completed the explorations on June 26, 2024, and issued its report on August 10, 2024. The report concluded by majority vote that the \"EIA not required\" decision is lawful.",

According to the Turkish EIA regulation, an EIA is required for some oil projects and expert examination is needed for some projects to determine whether an EIA is required. The exploration and drilling project (Permit No: AR/PRT/K/M45-C) of Çalık Petroleum Exploration and Production Company in Diyarbakir, Bismil, Harmanli Village 112 block 2 plot, which is in question, belongs to the second group. The Diyarbakır Governorship issued a decision that EIA is not required for the project. The claimants argue that the decision of “EIA not required” was unlawful.

When searching for oil, a series of explosions are often used to understand what is underground. This is called a seismic test. The claimants argue that seismic testing destroys wildlife and soil. Second, when searching for oil, taking into account that the substances used in drilling wells are toxic and that the debris carried to the surface during drilling contains radioactive minerals and heavy metals, agricultural areas, underground and surface waters will be in danger.

Many of the other conditions in Annex 50 have also not been met. Many of the special permits, planning required by Article 48/2 and Articles 6 and 9, as well as the documents required by Article 24 of the Turkish Petroleum Law, are missing. The claimants also suggest that hundreds of mining and oil projects have been launched in Bismil and Diyarbakir in recent months, there is no cumulative impact assessment in the introduction file. It is argued that in the file, the real impact of this project on humans and the environment, as has not been taken into consideration. It has been stated that \"the project implementer will undertake to take sufficient precautions in such cases during the activity\" against the most critical hazardous issues. However, scientific planning and activities have not been concretized. They also assert that in the project area, there are wildlife forms which are protected by the Bern Convention of The Council of Europe.\r\n\r\nSecond, the Claimants argue that the oil exploration and extraction activities are also contrary to the global climate goals that Turkey is a party to. They state that the greenhouse gases resulting from the use of oil create a heat-trapping effect in the atmosphere and cause climate change. Turkey, in accordance with many international agreements, especially the Paris Climate Agreement, to which it is a party, is obliged to limit the temperature increase to 2 degrees and contribute to the mitigation against climate change. And the only way to do this is to reduce carbon emissions, in other words, to exit fossil fuels. \r\nThey also refer to the most recent climate adaptation strategy document of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, namely \"Ecosystem-Based Adaptation Strategy to Climate Change for Anatolian Steppe Ecosystems\" dated July 6, 2022. The Strategy Document, which covers agriculture, pastures and meadows, inland waters and forests for the period 2022-2036, aims to:\r\n•        Increase resilience in ecosystems that are and will be negatively affected by climate change, \r\n•        Make rural population resistant to climate with improved agricultural economy, \r\n•        Increase carbon sink potential. \r\n\r\nThe Claimants put forward, however, the activity in question will serve to increase global warming by polluting water and agricultural resources and paving the way for fossil fuel use. In other words, they argue that the current activity is clearly in conflict with Turkish national plans. Therefore, Claimants argue that the project which bears all those risks mentioned above can’t be exempted from the Environmental Impact Assessment. The Claimants state that the project should be annulled altogether but even if it continues to exist, because an Environmental Impact Assessment procedure is scientifically essential, the decision of “EIA not required” should be annulled.\r\n\r\nOn June 4, 2023, the Court decided to appoint an independent expert committee for an exploration of the field to prepare an expert opinion. The committee completed the explorations on June 26, 2024 and issued its report July 23, 2024, which is contrary to the arguments of the Claimant. The Court’s decision is pending.\r\n",

      "count": 1,
      "summary": "The case has been filed against Diyarbakır Governership, for the suspension of execution and annulment of the decision of “EIA not required”, issued about an oil exploration and extraction project.  According to the Turkish regulation of EIA, an EIA is required for some oil projects and expert examination is needed to determine whether an EIA is required. The exploration and drilling project (Permit No: \"AR/TPO/K/L42-c1,c3,c4) of TPAO (Turkish Petroleum)in Diyarbakir, Cermik, Petekkaya Village 154 block 18 plot, which is in question, belongs to the second group. The Diyarbakır Governorship issued a decision that EIA is not required for the project. The claimants argue that the decision of “EIA not required” was unlawful. The claimants refer to several grounds to support their argument.  First, they refer to the seismic tests. When searching for oil, a series of explosions are used to understand what is underground. This is called a seismic test. The claimants argue that seismic testing destroys wildlife and soil. Second, when searching for oil, taking into account that the substances used in drilling wells are toxic and that the debris carried to the surface during drilling contains radioactive minerals and heavy metals, agricultural areas underground and surface waters will be in danger. In addition, toxic liquids coming out of the ground because of the exploration activity will mix with the air, soil, underground water and other water resources. Heavy metals in the fluids brought to the surface will also negatively affect agricultural and animal husbandry activities. Consequently, human health will also be seriously negatively affected. The claimants argue that the “EIA not required” the decision issued by the Diyarbakır Governorship might be a threat to agricultural production and that an EIA process should be carried out. There are water wells and agricultural areas under and around the oil field. \r\n\r\nNonetheless, the claimants note that hundreds of mining and oil projects have been launched in Cermik and Diyarbakir area in recent months, without any cumulative impact assessment in the introduction file. \r\nIn the product introduction file, it was stated that only 3 tons of caustic chemicals would be used and tens of tons of different chemicals would also be used. TPAO, established a financial responsibility insurance for potential hazards which means the dangers mentioned above are most probable. Also, the area of the project is an agricultural area. Food security is a growing issue worldwide and projects which are threats to agriculture are also threatening food security.\r\n\r\nThe Claimants assert that there are houses and people living as close as 178 meters from the project area, with wells, pastures and agricultural areas close by. They refer to the conditions in Annex 50, as required by Article 46/3 of the Turkish Petroleum Law Implementation Regulation, stating that the conditions have not been met. Many of the other conditions in Annex 50 have also not been met. Many of the special permits, planning required by Article 48/2 and Articles 6 and 9, as well as the documents required by Article 24 of the Turkish Petroleum Law, are missing. In its opinion regarding the field of activity, DSI (State Hydraulic Works) stated that the area was surrounded by drilling wells and indicated that water analyses should be conducted. In addition, DSI stated that the opinion of the 15th Regional Directorate regarding the nearby dam should be obtained, thus revealing the danger. However, surface waters were not mentioned in the introduction file. Claimants further refer to the National Water Board of Turkey which was recently established by the Presidential Decree on November 29, 2023.  This oil exploration and extraction activity is clearly against this decree, considering that every place has recently been declared an oil exploration and extraction area, and water resources are being endangered.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, there are wildlife forms protected by the Bern Convention of The Council of Europe in the project area. Animals like “Night Frog”, “Thin and Broad-Toed Lizard”, “Field Lizard”, “Evening Bat” are endemic to the area, and they are protected by the convention. In addition, the claimants argue that the oil exploration and extraction activities are also contrary to the global climate goals that Turkey is a party to. They state that GHGs resulting from the use of oil create a heat-trapping effect in the atmosphere and cause climate change. Turkey, in accordance with many international agreements, especially the Paris Agreement, to which it is a party, is obliged to limit the temperature increase to 2 degrees and contribute to the mitigation against climate change. And the only way to do this is to reduce GHG emissions, and stop exploiting fossil fuels. The activity in question will serve to increase global warming by polluting water and agricultural resources and paving the way for fossil fuel use. Therefore, Claimants argue that the project which bears all those risks can’t be exempted from an EIA. The claimants state that the project should be annulled or, at the very least, that the decision of “EIA not required” should be annulled.\r\n\r\nOn May 14, 2024, the Court decided to appoint an independent expert committee for an exploration of the field to prepare an expert opinion. The committee completed the explorations on June 26, 2024 and issued its report August 10, 2024. The report concluded by majority vote that the ‘EIA not required’ decision is lawful.

Copel owns the plant, and it is alleged that there are unlawful practices in its environmental licensing and operations, resulting in environmental and climate damage. It is claimed that the coal used by the power plant contains a high concentration of radioactive elements, causing the atmosphere, climate, water, and soil degradation. The environmental agency reportedly denied access to documents regarding the environmental licensing of the activity, and the UTE allegedly operated for 18 years without the required Operating Licence, emitting pollutants above the limits allowed by law. Additionally, the plant's expansion reportedly proceeded without a licensing process and operated for 35 years without mechanisms to control particulate emissions.\r\n\r\nThe plaintiff argued that the climate damage caused by illegal GHG emissions should be quantified based on the social cost of carbon, with carbon pricing estimates provided by the World Bank and OECD. The plaintiff requests that the defendant provide documents and for an expert examination to accurately quantify the emissions, as the emissions presented by the UTE’s operation were estimated by the plaintiffs without access to the necessary documents. The plaintiff asks for an injunction, including document and report disclosure, the production of advance evidence to assess environmental damage, and the suspension of environmental and regulatory licensing procedures. Ultimately, it is requested that: (i) the environmental licensing process and authorizations permitting the plant's expansion be annulled; (ii) the defendants be ordered to cease operations until a proper licensing process is conducted, accompanied by an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA/RIMA) and necessary technical studies; (iii) the cancellation of the environmental compensation agreement; (iv) the defendants be ordered to restore environmental damage caused by the UTE's irregular operations and pay compensation for irreversible damage; (v) the defendants be ordered to pay compensation for climate damage due to the UTE's irregular operation; and (vi) the payment of collective environmental moral damages.\r\n\r\nOn September 1, 2024, the Court denied the request for an injunction. It was argued that the evidence requested could be produced at an appropriate stage in the proceedings, and there was no need for early production. It was also noted that UTE Figueira has been in operation for a long time and contributes to the electricity supply in the state of Paraná; therefore, granting the injunction measures could pose a risk to consumers.\r\n",

      "summary": "In March 2018, Santo Antônio Energia S.A. filed a Claim for the Annulment of an Administrative Act, with a request for injunction, against the State Agency for Environmental Development of Rondônia (SEDAM). The Santo Antônio Hydroelectric Plant (UHE Santo Antônio) operates a large hydroelectric plant located in the Amazon region. Construction activities required the removal of vegetation along the banks of the Madeira River, for which subcontractors were hired. During the vegetation clearance, the Environmental Commission of the Rondônia State Legislative Assembly received complaints that the subcontractors were setting fires in areas of the Santo Antônio and Jirau Hydroelectric Plants. SEDAM issued an infraction notice, alleging that the subcontractors burned 2,280 hectares of vegetation (1,750 hectares belonging to Santo Antônio S.A.) and imposed a fine of R$10,000,000.00. In its claim, the plaintiff asserts that the fires in question were criminal and that it took all necessary preventive measures. It seeks recognition of the statute of limitations or, alternatively, the annulment of the administrative act on the grounds of defects and the absence of elements necessary to establish administrative liability. As an injunction, the company requests the suspension of the enforceability of the fine and an order for SEDAM to refrain from taking any action that would require payment of the fine. On the merits, it requests the annulment of the infraction notice, or alternatively, an adjustment to the applied penalty or reduction of the fine amount.\r\n\r\nThe state of Rondônia filed a defence contesting the arguments presented in the initial claim and requested that the claim be dismissed.\r\n\r\nThe court issued a judgment partially upholding the initial claim to adjust the fine to R$5,000,000.00.\r\n\r\nBoth the plaintiff and the state of Rondônia filed appeals.\r\n\r\nOn September 22, 2023, the Court dismissed both appeals. The dissenting vote granted the state of Rondônia’s appeal to reinstate the original fine, considering that the amount imposed by SEDAM was reasonable, given that the fire affected 1,750 hectares of the company's land and lasted for 15 days. It argued that Federal Decree 6,514/2008 states that, when grading the penalty, the extent of the damage and its environmental impact must be taken into account. The dissent emphasized that one hectare of burned forest equates to hundreds of tonnes of CO₂ released into the atmosphere, contributing to Brazil's high GHG emissions. It highlighted the provisions of CNJ Resolution 433/2021 and the targets Brazil has committed to under the Paris Agreement. The opinion argued that, given the climate crisis and current regulatory standards, the environmental authority's discretion to set the amount of fines imposed cannot be restricted.\r\n",

      "summary": "In April 2024, the Partido Democrático Trabalhista (PDT), a political party, filed a Direct Action of Unconstitutionality (ADI) challenging the constitutionality of Articles 4, item I; 5, items V, VII, XI, and XIII; 6; 7, caput and § 2; and 13, caput and § 1 of Federal Law 13.576/2017 – the National Biofuels Policy Act (RenovaBio). The aim of the action is to deregulate the carbon market established by this policy. The party alleges a formal defect in the legislative process, claiming that the legislative process was diverted to serve private interests at the expense of environmental protection. On substantive grounds, it is argued that the law infringes constitutional provisions related to an ecologically balanced environment, the social function of property, the prohibition of insufficient protection, and free enterprise. The party contends that the law’s actual purpose is to provide financial support to the biofuels sector rather than to protect the environment. This assertion is based on RenovaBio’s alleged failure to contribute effectively to GHG emission reductions due to the lack of additionality in Decarbonization Credits (CBIOs), meaning no measurable and effective reduction in GHG emissions or CO₂ removal occurs, as required by the law, to genuinely mitigate climate change.\r\n\r\nThe party further argues that RenovaBio represents state intervention in the economic domain, selectively benefiting producers and importers without delivering corresponding environmental protection and concealing environmentally harmful practices under the guise of meeting international commitments under the Paris Agreement. Additionally, the law places the responsibility for decarbonizing the entire fossil fuel supply chain on distributors, despite their accounting for only a portion of the agents involved, thereby creating an inequitable regulatory burden. The action seeks a declaration of formal and substantive unconstitutionality of Federal Law 13.576/2017, with partial nullity without textual reduction, and interpretation aligned with the Constitution for Articles 4, item I; 5, items XXIII, V, VII, XI, and XIII; 6; 7, caput and § 2; and 13, caput and § 1.\r\n\r\nThe claimant party subsequently requested to withdraw the action, but it was not dismissed due to the principle of indisposability, which governs concentrated constitutional control actions.\r\n",

      "summary": "On December 12, 2023, the Arayara International Institute of Education and Culture filled an Autonomous Action for the Anticipated Production of Evidence against the National Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuels Agency (ANP) and the Federal Union, with the aim of having them clarify the climate impact of their offers of blocks for oil and gas exploration. The plaintiff argues that the emissions associated with the ANP's offers of blocks for oil and gas exploration could compromise compliance with the targets set by Brazil under the Paris Agreement, which have been internalized in the Brazilian legal system with supra-legal status. Also, it is argued that oil and gas exploration contradicts the national energy policy's objectives, which include protecting the environment and mitigating GHG emissions. The plaintiff states there is no transparency about the calculations or emission estimates associated with the ANP's offers of blocks for oil and gas exploration or mitigation plans. He, therefore, seeks to provide the information needed to assess these impacts and possibly avoid the need for subsequent legal action to correct the country's energy policies. Specifically, the aim is to clarify whether the federal government (i) estimates the GHG emissions potentially generated by the offer of oil and gas exploration blocks in ANP auctions at the time of or before the publicity of the offer notice; (ii) calculates how the emissions that will result from the oil and gas exploration of the blocks offered, if they are acquired, may affect compliance with the Brazilian NDC and the Paris Agreement; (iii) has some kind of calculation or analysis of how emissions from burning Brazilian oil exported to other countries affect the global climate system; (iv) has a plan for mitigating emissions from oil and gas exploration in the blocks offered by the ANP; and (v) takes these emissions into account when establishing the country's energy policy.\r\n\r\nOn July 4, 2024, ANP filed its defense and argued that energy sources in the future will still include oil and natural gas. It said that ANP only implements public policies in the energy sector and is not responsible for formulating them and, therefore, the requests in the lawsuit should be addressed to the body that formulates the policy, the National Energy Policy Council (CNPE). Finally, it argued that the offer of blocks for the exploration and production of oil and natural gas, in itself, does not have the effect of emitting GHGs since there is no guarantee of the occurrence of deposits in these regions and, therefore, it would not be possible to estimate in advance the result of emissions from eventual production in the auctioned block.\r\n\r\nOn July 18, 2024, the Federal Union filed its defense and made the following responses: (i) GHG emissions are calculated indirectly, based on existing activities and historical data, and the assessment of an oil or natural gas discovery takes place only in an area under an exploration and production contract; (ii) the official means of verifying the national target is the National Inventory of GHG Emissions and Removals, which is submitted periodically to the UNFCCC; (iii) calculations of national GHG emissions from the energy sector do not account for emissions from the future use of exported oil, as these emissions are accounted for by the countries that import the oil; (iv) Brazil has established projects, activities, programmes and policy measures to monitor and mitigate its emissions, monitor impacts and adapt to climate change; (v) the deliberations of the CNPE, the body responsible for formulating energy policies and guidelines, are based on studies, assessments and technical documents from government bodies and entities in the energy sector, and these documents do not include data on potential emissions. A request was made for the case to be dismissed without a decision on the merits and, alternatively, for the procedure to be recognized as exhausted given the information presented in the Information Note.\r\n",

      "summary": "On September 12, 2024, the Federal Environment Agency Chico Mendes Institute for Biodiversity Conservation (ICMBio) filed a Public Civil Action (ACP) against Sandra Mara Silveira, the late Pedro Cordeiro's estates, Marcio Natalino Piovesan Cordeiro, Adrielle Silveira Piovezan and Davi Silveira Piovazan for illegal deforestation. Compensation is being sought exclusively for climate damage related to environmental offenses committed in an area of 7,075 hectares, comprised of three farms overlapping the Jamanxin National Forest. \r\n\r\nThe plaintiff maintains that the case does not deal with the recovery of the degraded area or compensation for material damage and collective moral damage, which are already the subject of a lawsuit filed by the Federal Public Prosecutor's Office. The area had already been subject to several infraction notices, embargoes, and interdiction notices issued by IBAMA and ICMBio. The plaintiff claims that the climate damage results from illegal acts of deforestation, fires, the use of herbicides, the introduction of exotic species, the destruction of permanent preservation areas, and the prevention of regeneration of native vegetation to raise cattle in the federal public domain area. These actions are responsible for the illegitimate emission of greenhouse gasses (GHG), causing climate damage. In addition, keeping cattle aggravates the climate damage within the National Forest, considering the methane emitted. Based on the polluter pays principle, ICMBio claims that the negative climate externality represents an external social cost not internalized by the activity of illegally suppressing vegetation, translated into the social cost of carbon (SCC). It argues that the compensation for climate damage can be quantified by multiplying the estimated GHG emissions from the activity by the SCC cost used by the OECD. ICMBio considers that the offenses were committed in specially protected territorial space, aggravating the environmental damage. It, therefore, requests a 50 percent increase in the value of the SCC, resulting in a quantum to be compensated of R$210,842,782.50. The plaintiff requests as an injunction (i) the immediate eviction from the area; (ii) a ban on exploitation of the area; (iii) the suspension of tax incentives and benefits and access to credit lines; (ii) the unavailability of assets in the amount estimated for the obligation to pay compensation for climate damage, and (iii) the unavailability of cattle in the area. It affirms the need to reverse the burden of proof and, definitively, requests that the defendant be ordered to pay the amount of the social cost of carbon.",

      "type": "case",
      "count": 1,
      "summary": "On January 22, 2024, Observatório do Clima has filed a Public Civil Action (ACP) against the federal environmental agency IBAMA and the National Department of Infrastructure and Transport (DNIT), seeking the annulment of the Preliminary License for the reconstruction and paving of the “middle section” of the BR-319 highway. \r\n\r\nThe plaintiff claims that paving the BR-319 would open new fronts for deforestation and land occupation in the Amazon. It says that in 2005, IBAMA began the licensing process for the paving of the middle section of the BR-319 highway, during which the environmental agency showed great concern about the increase in deforestation around the highway, the threat to biodiversity, and the potential for the grabbing of public land in the Amazon. However, according to Observatório do Clima, IBAMA's issuance of Preliminary License (LP) 672/2022 did not consider the environmental agency's previous concerns. It claims that the license was granted (i) without a climate impact study; (ii) without prior consultation with the traditional communities that the project would impact; (iii) despite the lack of minimum environmental governance to deal with the complexity of the environmental consequences of the project; and (iv) contrary to the guidelines of a Working Group formed by environmental agencies and an Inter Ministerial Committee, which indicated the need to adopt a series of measures associated with environmental governance before issuing the preliminary license. It highlights the importance of the Amazon rainforest for climate balance. It points out that deforestation in the biome would increase carbon dioxide emissions, exacerbate climate change, and that the absence of Free, Prior, and Informed Consultation would infringe on the rights of indigenous peoples. Observatório do Clima argues that the Brazilian legal system requires environmental licensing to assess the climate variable and failure to do so would render the preliminary license granted null and void. Based on the above, it requests a preliminary injunction to suspend the effectiveness of LP 672/2022, the reversal of the burden of proof, and, at the end of the trial, the annulment of the preliminary license, as well as any administrative acts arising from it.\r\n\r\nOn May 16, 2024, DNIT presented its defense, arguing that it had no legal standing and that the chosen procedure was inappropriate, and requested that the injunction be rejected. It argued for the presumption of legitimacy of administrative acts and the impossibility of judicial interference in administrative merit under penalty of violating the principle of separation of powers. It argued that it could not guarantee the socio-environmental measures needed around the BR-319 project, which are the responsibility of environmental, indigenous, land, and other bodies and agencies. Thus, it stated that environmental licensing could not make up for the lack of structure of the various bodies and authorities involved in environmental inspection policies and the prevention and control of deforestation in the Amazon. As for the request for a climate impact study, it argued that such an impact would derive from the possible increase in illegal deforestation generated by insufficient environmental governance in the areas close to the highway and would not be related to the technological solution applied to the project. It claimed that there had been prior consultation with indigenous peoples. In this way, it argued that it had complied with the environmental licensing process determined by IBAMA. \r\n\r\nOn May 17, 2024, IBAMA presented its defense, arguing the presumption of legitimacy of administrative acts and the impossibility of judicial review. It argued that DNIT, the project's proponent, lacked the administrative competence to carry out environmental policy measures, especially in the context of licensing. As for carrying out a climate impact study, it mentioned that the technical analyses assessed the issues directly related to the subject, such as deforestation, changes in land use, and adapting the project to climate events, and that the EIA/RIMA contained data for defining measures to control and mitigate these impacts. It argued that halting the licensing process would imply additional costs in preparing new assessments and studies and that there was no risk of damage to the useful outcome of the process, among other allegations.\r\n\r\nOn July 24, 2024, an injunction was issued in favor of the plaintiff's claims. The decision stated that the presumption of legality of administrative acts is relative and that the judiciary can control their constitutionality and legality. It questioned the validity of the preliminary license given the potentially severe environmental damage, such as deforestation, loss of biodiversity, damage to the climate system, and impacts on indigenous and traditional communities, among others. In this sense, the judge stated that a balanced environment is a human right and essential for the enjoyment of other rights, such as life and health, and that the judiciary is responsible for guaranteeing its protection against harm. The decision recognized that the case aims to ensure that the licensing process is carried out responsibly and adequately, guided by the technique and the best science applicable to control risks and damages, to allow the BR-319 project to coexist without undermining the duty to protect the Amazon rainforest. To this end, the lawsuit seeks compliance with the legal procedures for conducting technical studies, including climate impact studies and prior consultation with indigenous peoples and traditional communities. The decision stated that environmental licensing must include a climate diagnosis to establish adequate and proportionate mitigation and compensation measures under Brazilian legislation and international commitments. It affirmed the importance of the dimensions of climate mitigation and adaptation. It considered that the insufficiency of public policies and the lack of adequate state structures to prevent the rehabilitation of the BR-319 highway from destroying the Amazon rainforest had been demonstrated, ruling that the project was environmentally unfeasible. It, therefore, granted the request for the immediate suspension of the preliminary license.\r\n\r\nIBAMA, the Federal Union, and DNIT appealed the decision, and on October 7th, 2024, the Reporting Judge of the Federal Regional Court of the 1st Region decided to suspend the effects of the preliminary injunction. According to the judge, the appealed decision had mistakenly concluded that the granting of a preliminary license was related to the execution stage of the project. In fact, this administrative act was merely evaluative in nature.  It was argued that the permit issued fulfilled the objective of attesting to the environmental viability of the project. It argued that the EIA/RIMA adequately fulfilled its purpose of exposing the real and potential environmental damage resulting from the project. The decision also argued that there is no normative, jurisprudential, or doctrinal provision on the obligation to prepare a climate impact study. It concluded that the EIA/RIMA exhaustively identified the activities that generate GHG emissions, which would meet what the appealed decision qualified as a climate impact study. Finally, it understood that (i) the environmental licensing complied with the provisions of ILO Convention 169 regarding prior consultation, (ii) the EIA/RIMA recognized the need to implement public policies in the Amazon region, and (iii) stressed the importance of restructuring the BR-319 for the development of the region.",

IBAMA mentions a series of damages resulting from deforestation, including global warming and climate impacts. As a preliminary injunction, it requested that the economic use of the area be prohibited for the duration of the case, that funding and tax incentives and access to credit lines be suspended, and that the defendants' assets be declared unavailable to guarantee the restoration of the damage. On the merits, it requests the environmental recovery of 913.35.60 hectares of Amazon rainforest and the payment of compensation for the interim and residual damage caused to the environment, as well as moral damage and compensation for the illicit economic profit. \r\n\r\nOn July 3, 2022, Observatório do Clima filed its amicus brief to subsidize the decision on the merits regarding the need for express recognition of the climate damage. It argues that international commitments and national legislation guarantee the right to climate stability, an integral part of the fundamental right to an ecologically balanced environment. According to the NGO, the plaintiff's claim for compensation for interim and residual damages includes climate damage, with global warming and climate impacts having been expressly mentioned in the initial petition as damages resulting from deforestation. However, it claimed that, when the case was filed, there was no methodology to quantify the damage, leading IBAMA to request that it be calculated at the liquidation stage. Observatório do Clima then submitted a Technical Note with a methodology for quantifying and pricing the carbon dioxide (CO2) released into the atmosphere due to the deforestation of the area mentioned in the initial petition. Based on the standard price of US$5.00/tCO2e, practiced by the Amazon Fund to raise funds for forest preservation, the climate damage in this case was calculated at R$23,159,018.18. It argued that climate damage resulting from illegal deforestation is an environmental damage that cannot be ignored, especially considering the principle of full reparation of environmental damages.\r\n\r\nOn March 5, 2024, the court granted the admission of the NGOs Observatório do Clima and Instituto Arayara as amicus curiae.   ",

      "summary": "An NGO, Declic, had been advocating for the suspension of the effects of the government decision which decided on the expropriation of land with forest vegetation concerning the Mihăileni Accumulation project, which raises significant legal issues and has been the subject of judicial scrutiny by the courts of Cluj. (see judgment rendered in case no. 513/117/2022). Given this legal context, expropriating predominantly forested land for the purpose of deforestation is not only premature but also illegal. It violates both national and EU rules assumed by Romania regarding preventing water body deterioration, mitigating climate change, and protecting biodiversity. The government's decision was adopted without conducting an environmental impact assessment, and the project's operations were to be carried out under a building permit issued in 1987.\r\n\r\nThe plaintiff asserted that in the absence of a suspension of the effects of the government decision pending the determination of the main action:\r\n1.        The expropriation of housing, productive land, and forests would result in their destruction and replacement by an artificial accumulation. Such an action would inevitably result in irreparable ecological damage.\r\n2.        When the area is flooded, the methane stored in the forested land will be released into the atmosphere. Forests are a natural carbon store. The greenhouse effect of methane is approximately 29 times that of carbon dioxide over 100 years, 86 times over 20 years, and more than 100 times over a few years. The damage to the climate will be irreparable.\r\n\r\nThe plaintiff referenced Paul Crutzen, the Dutch chemist who, along with other scientists, was awarded the Nobel Prize for discovering the effects of ozone-depleting compounds: \"...humans have altered the composition of the atmosphere. Because of fossil fuel and deforestation, the concentration of carbon dioxide in the air has increased by 40% over the last two centuries, while the concentration of methane, an even more potent greenhouse compound, has almost doubled.\"\r\n\r\nThe Cluj Court of Appeal found prima facie in agreement with the applicant that there are contradictions between the finding of the cross-sectoral nature of flood management and the concrete measures to be taken, namely deforestation, which appears to be at odds with the concepts of sustainable development and forestry development. In that regard, the Court noted that at this stage, there are no studies to determine to what extent the change in land use will impact the climate, contrary to Romania's commitments to reduce GHG emissions.  Building upon his initial observations, Judge Simon Antoniu noted that these potential environmental impacts not only contradict the existing legal framework at the national level but also appear to diverge from the interpretation of the Court of Justice of the European Union regarding the deterioration of riverine ecosystems. In light of the considerations above, it is imperative that this action be avoided and that states are held to the obligation \"to refuse to authorize a project if it is likely to deteriorate the status of the body of water in question or to compromise the achievement of good status of surface water bodies\" (Judgment in Case C-461/13 Bund fur Umwelt und Naturschutz Deutschland eV v Bundesrepublik Deutschland, paragraph 50).\r\n\r\nThe judgment no. 219/2022 is final, as the appeal filed by the Romanian Government was rejected in October 2023 by the High Court of Cassation and Justice.",

      "type": "case",
      "count": 1,
      "summary": "On November 7, 2024, a coalition of European non-governmental organizations (NGOs) formally submitted coordinated complaints to the European Commission,* seeking the initiation of infringement proceedings against France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, and Sweden for alleged violations of their legal obligations under European Union (EU) law concerning their National Energy and Climate Plans (NECPs).\r\n\r\nThese complaints are supported by evidence demonstrating that the NECPs of the aforementioned Member States are insufficient and fail to comply with the EU’s binding climate and energy targets. The NGOs contend that these plans lack adequate and effective measures to transform the stated commitments into tangible outcomes and fail to incorporate meaningful public participation in developing socially equitable policies. Despite the deadline for submission of NECPs having passed on June 30, 2024, only 14 Member States have complied, and the coalition asserts that these delays and deficiencies undermine the EU’s overarching climate objectives and the principle of a just transition for its citizens.\r\n\r\nThe complaint against France, submitted by the organization Notre Affaire à Tous (NAAF), alleges extensive non-compliance with EU climate and energy law. Specifically, NAAF highlights that France’s transition measures are inequitable, jeopardizing their implementation and public acceptance. While France has committed to a gross reduction of emissions by 50% by 2030, compared to 1990 levels, this pledge is contradicted by an “apparent disregard” for its net emissions obligations, which include the role of carbon sinks. According to NAAF, France’s NECP effectively acknowledges a collapse in its natural carbon sinks, with the absorption of CO2 by these sinks projected to decline from an earlier target of -42 MtCO2eq to -8 MtCO2eq for the 2024–2028 carbon budget, far below the EU-mandated minimum of -31 MtCO2eq. This significant reduction would result in a net increase in emissions during this period, in direct contravention of EU requirements.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, NAAF asserts that critical sectors such as transport and buildings, which are central to France’s National Low Carbon Strategy (Stratégie Nationale Bas Carbone, or SNBC), have suffered from severe policy regressions and financial cutbacks. Examples include reductions in funding for the “Ma Prime Rénov” renovation grant and the national cycling plan. NAAF also points to delays in renewable energy projects, jeopardizing France’s commitment to achieving 45% renewable energy in final energy consumption by 2030. The organization concludes that the abandonment, postponement, or rollback of numerous measures within the NECP raises serious concerns regarding the plan's credibility and France’s capacity to meet its stated goals.\r\n\r\nNAAF further contends that France’s approach to public consultation undermines the legitimacy of its NECP. Although France submitted its NECP months ago, it is still conducting public consultations on related climate planning documents, such as SNBC 3 and the Multiannual Energy Plan (Programmation Pluriannuelle de l'Énergie, or PPE). However, certain elements currently under consultation have already been incorporated as binding commitments in the NECP. NAAF argues that this process casts doubt on the authenticity of the government’s intent to genuinely consider public and stakeholder input. NAAF emphasizes that robust and inclusive consultation processes are essential, particularly given the socially unjust decisions codified in the NECP. For instance, France has effectively abandoned a meaningful fight against energy poverty: the NECP sets a modest target to reduce the percentage of households experiencing energy poverty by just 0.5% by 2030, from 11.6% in 2022 to 11.1%, despite these households being increasingly vulnerable to climate and energy-related challenges.\r\n\r\n*Pursuant to EU law, the European Commission is mandated to ensure that Member States fulfill their legal obligations. Should the Commission determine that a Member State is in breach, it may initiate formal infringement proceedings to bring national legislation and practices into compliance with EU law. The Commission has 12 months to respond to these complaints.\r\n",

      "summary": "Marmara Lake, located in the city of Manisa, Turkey, was designated as a wetland of national importance in 2017 and has since been protected under the Regulation on Conservation of Wetlands. The lake is an alluvial barrier lake and serves as an important carbon sink. To provide water to the city of Izmir, the government allocated water resources to the Gördes Dam, which led to a depletion of resources for Marmara Lake, causing it to dry up over the last ten years, losing almost ninety-eight percent of its surface area. In 2022, a lawsuit was filed regarding rent and an order of payment that the government sought from the fishers. The court ruled in favor of the claimants, who then filed another lawsuit against several government agencies for allowing the area, formerly known as Lake Marmara, to be used for agricultural activities through the “Cooperation Protocol on Rehabilitation of Marmara Lake Wetland,” dated November 4, 2022.\r\n\r\nThe discovery and expert examination of the lake within the file occurred on March 25. Following this examination, the experts submitted a report to the court on July 1, 2024. The report stated, \"Marmara Lake is suitable for regaining its wetland and lake characteristics as a result of relevant activities and natural factors.\" In the expert report, it was also concluded that “the planned agricultural activities in the lake basin under the protocol will negatively impact the potential for the lake to return to a wetland in the future. These activities will adversely affect the lake basin, groundwater and surface waters, as well as the ecosystems in the lake basin and its surroundings. Furthermore, the relevant protocol and commission decision do not comply with Environmental Law No. 2872 and the associated regulations and legislation.\" In response to the expert report, the court decided to stay the execution, noting that the number of days without rain has increased due to climate change, normal rainfall has decreased, and heavy rainfall has risen. Consequently, the court emphasized the importance of wetlands, stating that the lake area might be needed in emergency situations.\r\n\r\nFollowing the final hearing on November 4, 2024, the court stated that the expert report evaluated the potential damage to the wetland caused by agricultural activities and the chemicals used in these activities, as well as the disruption of the ecological integrity, structural balance, and ecosystem structure of the wetland resulting from the conversion of the lake into an agricultural area. It was determined that the transactions related to the “Marmara Lake Wetland Rehabilitation Collaboration” protocol and the decisions of the National Wetland Commission regarding the approval and implementation of the boundaries of the revised Marmara Lake Wetland Protection Zones are unlawful. Consequently, the court canceled the cooperation protocol and the boundary revision decision on November 6, 2024, stating that the implementation of the mentioned protocol and decisions would cause damage that is difficult or impossible to compensate for when considering the environmental impacts.\r\n",

      "summary": "This case concerns the regulation of competition law regarding gas pipeline services in New Zealand. The plaintiff, representing the largest gas consumers in the country, sued New Zealand’s competition regulator, the Commerce Commission. They challenged decisions in which the Commission effectively allowed the country’s largest gas pipeline operators to raise prices to recover higher short-term costs in light of New Zealand’s announced phase-out of fossil fuels. The Commission essentially adjusted the useful lives of gas pipeline assets to account for this phase-out and accelerated the depreciation of those assets. \r\n\r\nThe first of the two decisions hinged on a challenge to the Commission's selected \"input methodologies\" in making its decision. Section 52Z of the Commerce Act states that challenges to the Commission’s input methodologies can only succeed if the plaintiff identifies an alternative methodology that is “materially better in meeting the purpose” of the Commerce Act’s competition regulation provisions. In this instance, the Court determined that the plaintiff failed to identify a materially better methodology, concluding that the Commission’s decision fulfilled the purposes of the Act—such as promoting the long-term benefit of consumers by reflecting long-run supply costs and acknowledging the risk of stranded assets. The Court rejected arguments claiming that the decision was premature, contrary to the specific purposes of input methodologies, or that it overcompensated suppliers at the expense of consumers.\r\n\r\nIn the second decision, the Court concluded that the Commission’s ruling did not satisfy the threshold of an error of law (namely that the Commission had not failed to apply the correct legal test, had not misconstrued or misunderstood the law, and had not made a clearly untenable decision).",

Government modeling acknowledges that this will reduce the uptake of hybrid and electric vehicles. Section 167C states that before setting clean car standards, the Minister of Transport must “be satisfied … that the targets are set at an appropriate level to increase the supply of zero- and low-emissions vehicles in the market.” Standards must also be “consistent with transport-specific policies and strategies outlined in the emissions reduction plan.” The Better New Zealand Trust argues that the new targets will “decrease compared to the previous targets, and that the Emissions Reduction Plan target to have 30% of the fleet as EVs by 2035 will be that much harder to achieve.”",

The plaintiff asserts that the defendant violated Ley N.º 19.300 (General Environmental Law) by failing to implement mitigation, repair, and compensation measures, as well as neglecting to enter the Environmental Impact Assessment System (SEIA). Consequently, significant environmental harm ensued, including the destruction of sediments, alteration of topography, loss of surface runoff, and degradation of critical ecosystem services. The plaintiff further emphasizes the damage to microbiota and extremophile microbial ecosystems (EMEs), which possess scientific value, particularly in astrobiology.\r\n\r\nThe plaintiff emphasizes that climate change intensifies these impacts, citing the Sixth IPCC Report (2021), which highlights the vulnerability of unique ecosystems like the Salar to climate change. Increased summer rainfall worsens environmental degradation and disrupts the Salar’s role as a climate refuge, which is critical for sustaining biodiversity both regionally and globally. The plaintiff also references Chile’s international obligations under the Ramsar Convention, the Convention on Biological Diversity, and the Paris Agreement, along with the Climate Change Framework Law (Ley N.º 21.455), which outlines long-term climate management strategies. Furthermore, the plaintiff invokes Article 19, No. 8 of the Chilean Constitution, which guarantees the right to live in an environment free from pollution and requires the State to protect nature.\r\n\r\nThe plaintiff contends that the defendant’s actions, which violate both domestic and international environmental obligations, have inflicted irreparable damage on the ecosystem and biodiversity of the Salar de Surire. To mitigate further harm, the plaintiff has requested a complete suspension of Quiborax’s mining operations, a measure granted by resolution on September 11, 2024. The plaintiff seeks reparative or compensatory measures in line with relevant environmental laws and commitments.\r\n\r\nThe defendant argues that the claim is inadmissible due to res judicata, as a prior judgment by the First Civil Court of Arica, confirmed by the Court of Appeals, ruled over a decade ago that there was no environmental damage in the Salar de Surire, no negligence by Quiborax, and no obligation to enter the SEIA process. The defendant also asserts that the action is time-barred, as the alleged damage began 37 years ago, far exceeding the statutory limitation period. Additionally, the defendant contends that the claimed environmental harm does not exist, as the impacts are inherent to regulated mining activities conducted under valid authorizations and continuous oversight. It denies causation, attributing changes in the Salar’s lagoons to climatic factors such as temperature and rainfall. Finally, it rejects the presumption of liability under Article 52 of Law No. 19.300, arguing that no infringement has been proven and that the court lacks direct sanctioning authority.

      "summary": "The case concerned an application by a wind farm company for planning permission to construct a wind farm in Co. Laois. An Bord Pleanála (the national planning authority) rejected permission for the wind farm, citing visual impacts and local development plan designations for wind turbines. Under the local Laois County Development Plan, wind farms would not be constructed in the relevant area based on the alleged visual concerns. Still, as the national planning authority, An Bord Pleanála could grant permission for the wind farm regardless of any alleged material contravention of the County Development Plan. In this instance, however, the planning permission was refused in line with the visual concerns outlined in the original County Development Plan.\r\n\r\nThe company sought to appeal the decision before the High Court, arguing inter alia that under S15(1) of the Climate Act, as well as in line with EU law and obligations under the European Convention on Human Rights, the planning authority had an obligation to interpret its planning decisions such that climate considerations would take priority over the visual concerns and that the authority had therefore taken inadequate account of S15(1) of the Climate Act. The planning authority argued in response that a narrow interpretation of this provision was appropriate, obliging the authority only to give regard to climate considerations and that the authority had, therefore, acted within its powers in refusing permission for the wind farm. \r\n\r\nThe High Court, in a ruling by Humphreys J. upheld the appeal, finding that An Bord Pleanála had acted unlawfully by failing to exercise its powers in a manner compliant as far as practicable with the climate objectives and policies set out in the Climate Act, and had also breached its duties under EU law and European human rights law. The Court noted that \"if climate goals take precedence over visual impacts  [as had been found in a previous case of  Nagle View Turbine Aware Group v. An Bord Pleanála [2024] IEHC 603 (Unreported, High Court, 1st November 2024)] and the like, then logically they must take precedence over development plan provisions that are motivated by visual impacts.” \r\n\r\nThe High Court further noted that the recent European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) decision in KlimaSeniorinnen v. Switzerland demonstrated that the requirement to read legislation in an ECHR-compliant manner supported an interpretation of S15 that went beyond the board’s approach and that the interpretation should ensure that ECHR obligations are complied with in practice, including compliance in practice with stated goals in relation to renewable energy infrastructure. The failure to properly consider the climate benefits of allowing the project, therefore, constituted a breach of Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights.\r\n\r\nTaking the importance of climate action into account, the Court held that the authority had not adequately considered S15(1) in its considerations of whether to grant permission in light of the need to consider climate objectives in contrast to the visual impacts and local planning concerns expressed by those opposed to the wind farms. It stated that \"the need for an imperative reading of S15(1) in line with what it says, namely that the board and any other relevant body is required to act in conformity with the climate plans and objectives set out in the subsection unless it is impracticable to do so.\" [117]\r\n\r\nThe Court, therefore, granted the appeal and ordered that the application be remitted to An Bord Pleanála for further consideration in accordance with the judgment.",

      "summary": "A protest action occurred in the Vatican Museums, where climate activists from Ultima Generazione glued their hands to the base of the renowned Laocoön sculpture, dating from 40–30 BCE. The activists also displayed a banner stating (in Italian), “Last Generation: No gas and no carbon.” Subsequently, they were prosecuted under the Vatican Penal Code for wanton destruction of property. The Governorate of the Vatican City State participated as a civil party in the proceedings, filing a claim for damages and seeking compensation for restoration costs and the intrinsic loss of value to the sculpture.\r\n\r\nBefore the Tribunal of Vatican City, the court of first instance, the issue was whether the activists' act of gluing their hands to a public monument (the base of the Laocoön sculpture) constituted \"wanton destruction of property\" under the Penal Code. Specifically, the question was whether the use of glue, which caused permanent damage to the marble base but not to the sculpture itself, met the threshold for intentional damage as defined by the Penal Code. The prosecution argued that the sculpture's status as a significant historical and artistic cultural artifact constituted an aggravating factor under Vatican Law No. VIII (July 11, 2013). The defense contended that the defendants’ motivation—to protest climate change—should be considered a mitigating factor in assessing their criminal liability and sanctions. Additionally, the court examined the degree of criminal intent involved in the defendants’ actions.\r\n\r\nThe Tribunal found the defendants guilty of wanton destruction of property under the Vatican Penal Code due to the damage inflicted on the base of the Laocoön Group sculpture. It considered the sculpture's status as a protected cultural property under Vatican Law No. VIII of July 11, 2013 (a monument of inestimable historical and artistic value) as an aggravating factor. The Tribunal rejected the defense's argument that the protest’s motivation (climate activism) should serve as a mitigating factor. Two defendants were sentenced to nine months of imprisonment, conditionally suspended for five years, and fined. The third defendant was only fined for her role in the protest, as she was found liable for resisting law enforcement and supporting the demonstration. As the civil party, the Governorate of Vatican City was awarded financial compensation for restoration expenses and the intrinsic loss in value of the artwork. The defendants were also ordered to pay legal costs associated with the proceedings.\r\n\r\nThe two defendants sentenced to imprisonment subsequently appealed to the Court of Appeals. The appellate court largely upheld the first-instance ruling in all respects. Discussions before the Court of Appeals focused on the appellants’ degree of criminal intent. The court found that their reckless intent satisfied the threshold required to establish criminal liability under Vatican law, thereby justifying the convictions and penalties imposed by the Tribunal. Additionally, the appellate court addressed the classification of the defendants’ actions, particularly the extent of the damage caused by the adhesive. The appellants argued that their actions should be classified as defacement or less severe damage rather than aggravated damage. However, the Court of Appeals affirmed the classification as aggravated damage and upheld the first-instance verdict.",

      "type": "case",
      "count": 1,
      "summary": "In accordance with Spain's special regime for renewable energy support, established by Law 54/1997 and further detailed in Royal Decree RD 661/2007, the claimant, Novenergia II – Energy & Environment (SCA), a Luxembourg-based investment fund, invested in Spain's photovoltaic (PV) sector on September 13, 2007. This regulatory framework assured renewable energy producers registered with the Administrative Registry for Electrical Power Generating Units (RAIPRE) a feed-in tariff (FIT) for the operational lifespan of their PV installations. However, the global economic downturn and a regulated electricity tariff set below the FITs rendered the support scheme financially unsustainable. Consequently, in 2013, Spain enacted a series of regulatory changes, replacing the existing regime with a less favorable one, which included measures such as a 7% tax on power generators' revenues and a reduction in subsidies for renewable energy producers.\r\n\r\nIn response, Novenergia initiated arbitration proceedings against Spain under the Arbitration Rules of the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce (SCC Case No. 063/2015), alleging that Spain's actions constituted a breach of its obligations under the Energy Charter Treaty (ECT), particularly the duty to provide fair and equitable treatment (FET) as outlined in Article 10(1) of the ECT. The tribunal found in favor of Novenergia, awarding €53.3 million in damages. \r\n\r\nSubsequently, Spain challenged the award before the Swedish Svea Court of Appeal, which annulled the award in December 2022. The court's decision was influenced by the Court of Justice of the European Union's (CJEU) ruling in Komstroy, which held that the dispute resolution mechanism of the ECT does not apply to intra-EU investment disputes.\r\n\r\nMain Legal Issue:\r\nThe main legal issue in this case is whether Spain's regulatory changes to its renewable energy support scheme, which replaced the guaranteed feed-in tariff (FIT) regime with a less favorable system, violated its obligations under the Energy Charter Treaty (ECT). Specifically, the case examines whether these changes breached the ECT's requirement to provide fair and equitable treatment (FET) to investors under Article 10(1).\r\n\r\nJurisdiction:\r\nThe arbitral tribunal rejected Spain's intra-EU jurisdictional objection. Spain argued that the tribunal lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate intra-EU investment disputes. First, it asserted that Article 26 of the Energy Charter Treaty (ECT), which governs arbitration, applies only to disputes between “a Contracting Party” and “an Investor of another Contracting Party” and claimed that this condition was not satisfied because both Spain and the European Union are ECT signatories. Second, citing Flaminio Costa v. ENEL, Spain contended that EU law should take precedence and override the ECT as the governing framework for intra-EU relations. The tribunal, however, disagreed, holding that its jurisdiction was based exclusively on the ECT and not on EU law.\r\n\r\nMerits:\r\ni. Whether Spain breached the fair and equitable treatment standard by enacting regulatory changes to its renewable energy support regime\r\nThe primary issue in the case was whether Spain breached the fair and equitable treatment (FET) standard under Article 10(1) of the Energy Charter Treaty (ECT) by retroactively altering its renewable energy support regime, thereby undermining the legitimate expectations of Novenergia. The claimant argued that Spain's repeal of the guaranteed fixed feed-in tariff (FIT) under RD 661/2007, a regime explicitly designed to attract photovoltaic (PV) investments, constituted a violation of the ECT's FET obligations. The tribunal ultimately agreed with Novenergia, concluding that Spain's 2013 and 2014 legislative changes fundamentally and retroactively transformed the regulatory framework in a manner inconsistent with the legitimate expectations of investors. These changes included abolishing the long-term FIT, which was a key feature of the original regime, and replacing it with a less favorable structure.\r\n\r\nThe tribunal ultimately held that Spain breached the FET standard for the following reasons:\r\n\r\nLegitimate Expectations and Regulatory Stability: The tribunal held that Spain had created legitimate and reasonable expectations for investors by promoting a stable and transparent regulatory framework. These expectations arose from explicit assurances provided through RD 661/2007, which guaranteed a fixed FIT for the operational lifespan of PV plants. The tribunal emphasized that such expectations are critical to the FET standard, as they inform the decision-making of investors when committing substantial capital to projects. It also referred to prior arbitral awards, such as Micula v. Romania and Eiser Infrastructure v. Spain, which underscored the importance of stability in the regulatory environment for long-term investments.\r\n\r\nRadical and Retroactive Nature of the Changes: The tribunal found that the 2013 and 2014 reforms enacted by Spain, which eliminated the fixed FIT retroactively, constituted a \"radical and unexpected\" departure from the legal and business environment in place when Novenergia made its investment. Citing CMS v. Argentina, the tribunal noted that such measures \"entirely transformed and altered\" the regulatory framework under which the investment had been made, crossing the threshold of what is permissible under the FET standard.\r\n\r\nBalancing State Interests with Investor Protection: While recognizing Spain's sovereign right to regulate in response to economic challenges, the tribunal emphasized that this right must be balanced against the need to protect investors’ legitimate expectations. Drawing from the reasoning in Saluka v. Czech Republic, the tribunal applied a balancing test, weighing Spain's regulatory objectives—such as addressing the tariff deficit—against the degree to which these measures undermined the expectations of investors. It concluded that Spain's actions disproportionately disrupted Novenergia's investment.\r\n\r\nTransparency and Lack of Warning: The tribunal determined that Spain failed to provide adequate warning or signals to investors about its intention to overhaul the regulatory regime. While Spain argued that it had announced structural reforms as early as 2008, the tribunal found these announcements insufficiently specific or clear. Investors were therefore unable to foresee the extent of the changes, particularly the retroactive abolition of the FIT, which was a critical element of the original framework.\r\n\r\nNon-Discrimination and Transparency: The tribunal also noted that the FET standard includes obligations of non-discrimination and transparency. It found that Spain's abrupt and retroactive measures lacked transparency and disproportionately affected PV investors, further contributing to the breach of the FET standard.\r\n\r\nThe tribunal concluded that Spain's 2013 and 2014 measures radically altered the regulatory framework in a way that breached the FET standard under Article 10(1) of the ECT. By undermining Novenergia's legitimate expectations without sufficient justification or warning, Spain failed to create and maintain stable and transparent investment conditions, entitling Novenergia to compensation. The case serves as a significant precedent in highlighting the delicate balance between a state's regulatory freedom and its obligations to foreign investors under international investment treaties.\r\n\r\nii. Whether Spain had expropriated Novenergia’s investment\r\nThe tribunal rejected Novenergia's claim of expropriation under Article 13(1) of the ECT. It reasoned that Novenergia remained the owner of its assets, including the PV plants and shares in the relevant companies, and that the measures did not constitute a direct or indirect taking of these assets. Although the regulatory changes reduced the value of Novenergia’s investment, this did not amount to an expropriation under international law.\r\n\r\nPost-Award Proceedings\r\nAfter the award was issued, Spain challenged it before the Swedish Svea Court of Appeal, which annulled the award in December 2022. The court's decision was influenced by the Court of Justice of the European Union's (CJEU) ruling in Komstroy, which held that the dispute resolution mechanism of the ECT does not apply to intra-EU investment disputes.",

The plaintiffs challenged the legality of the permit on multiple grounds, arguing that the project, which involves deforestation and the development of major hydro-technical infrastructure, was approved without sufficient consideration of updated environmental, climate, and public safety standards.\r\n\r\nThe claim centered on several procedural and substantive issues, including:\r\n(i) the alleged failure of the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) to assess the entire project comprehensively, focusing only on deforestation while omitting the full environmental effects of hydro-technical works;\r\n(ii) reliance on outdated permits and technical documentation from 1990, despite advancements in safety and environmental standards;\r\n(iii) alleged violations of Article 6(3)-(4) of the EU Habitats Directive and Article 28 of Government Emergency Ordinance (GEO) No. 57/2007;\r\n(iv) concerns over the adequacy of the public consultation process, which plaintiffs argued did not comply with the procedural requirements in Annex 5 of Law No. 292/2018;\r\n(v) the lack of an adequate assessment of the deforestation’s impact on climate mitigation, flood risks, and biodiversity.\r\n\r\nThe plaintiffs argued that the deforestation of 39.38 hectares of protected natural areas would negatively affect carbon storage, flood control, and the habitat of several protected species. They also questioned the project’s contribution to national energy objectives, noting that the hydropower plant’s estimated capacity of approximately 35 MW accounts for only 0.19% of Romania’s total installed generation capacity and would affect ten rivers.\r\n\r\nIn February 2025, the Cluj Administrative Court rejected the request for suspension, allowing work on the project to continue. The court sided with Hidroelectrica, the state-owned energy company leading the project, ruling that the environmental agreement could remain in effect pending the resolution of the main case. Romanian Energy Minister Sebastian Burduja described the ruling as a major victory for the country’s energy sector, noting that over 90% of the works were already completed and the project was on track to become the first hydropower plant finalized in Romania in over three decades. He emphasized its strategic importance for balancing the grid and enhancing energy security. The plaintiffs appealed the decision.\r\n\r\nOn June 4, 2025, the Cluj-Napoca Court of Appeal overturned the lower court’s ruling and ordered the suspension of the environmental permit. This decision is final with respect to the interim measure but does not resolve the underlying merits of the case, which are scheduled to be heard on June 24, 2025.\r\n\r\nThe Court of Appeal’s decision effectively halts the Răstolița Hydropower Project, which is reportedly over 90% complete and had been scheduled for commissioning in November 2025. According to the Romanian government, the project is one of strategic national interest and would be the first hydropower plant completed in the country in three decades. Officials, including the Minister of Energy, have emphasized the project's role in contributing to national energy security and reducing reliance on energy imports. They have also expressed concern that prolonged litigation has already caused significant financial losses for the state-owned energy company Hidroelectrica and the national budget—estimated at over 443 million euros in unproduced energy and related costs between 2019 and 2024.\r\n",

The MPF alleges that the defendant’s occupation of the land was illegal, as it was part of an Agro-Extractivist Settlement Project (PAE) owned and managed by the National Institute for Colonization and Agrarian Reform (INCRA) and occupied by traditional extractivist communities. This CPA is one of 22 lawsuits filed by the MPF as a result of an investigation conducted under Civil Inquiry No. 1.13.000.001719/2015-49 into illegal deforestation within the Antimary Agro-Extractivist Settlement Project (PAE), though each case involves different defendants. The lawsuit is based, among other things, on Brazilian environmental law concerning the constitutional protection of the environment, allegations of deforestation, propter rem civil liability for environmental damage (including climate damage), and collective moral damages. It also references the unauthorized emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG) caused by the illegal deforestation, calculated at 160,574.33 tons of carbon dioxide, which directly contribute to Brazil's deviation from its climate goals—placing it out of step with both national and international commitments established under the National Policy on Climate Change (PNMC) (Federal Law 12.187/2009) and the Paris Agreement (promulgated by Federal Decree 9.073/2017).\r\n\r\nAmong other requests, the lawsuit seeks:\r\n(i) reparation for the damage caused by illegal deforestation;\r\n(ii) payment of compensation for intermediate and residual material environmental damage;\r\n(iii) payment of compensation for climate damage; and\r\n(iv) payment of compensation for collective moral damages.\r\n\r\nOn May 13, 2022, Clair Cunha da Silva filed an answer, arguing that she lacked standing to be sued, as she only took possession of the land in 2019. She contended that the initial complaint alleges deforestation occurred between 2011 and 2020, yet there is no evidence that she engaged in deforestation after acquiring possession. Among other arguments, she claimed that the propter rem nature of environmental obligations applies only to the recovery of the area and that, due to the absence of proof linking her to the deforestation, there is no causal connection that would justify holding her civilly liable for material and moral damages. She, therefore, requested the dismissal of the lawsuit.",

The lawsuit seeks the annulment of the state decree that created a state park overlapping with a quilombola territory. The case highlights environmental racism as a major factor behind the marginalization of the Quilombola Community of Bombas, which has been denied its territorial rights due to the supposed incompatibility of these rights with local biodiversity protection. This is because the community's territory overlaps with the Alto Ribeira Tourist State Park (PETAR). The plaintiffs argue that the Quilombola peoples of that region are protectors of nature and have a relationship of mutual dependence with it. They, therefore, request Quilombola territorial recognition, a land survey with the removal of any third parties, the revocation or invalidation of State Decree 32.283/1958 (only regarding its impact on the Quilombola territory), the titling of the Quilombola territory, and the construction of a road providing adequate access to the community. The initial claim does not mention climate issues, which are referenced for the first time in the judgment.\r\n\r\nOn December 29, 2023, a ruling was issued upholding the initial claim in favor of the Quilombola Community of Bombas, recognizing the material invalidity of Decree 32.238/1958, which created PETAR, insofar as it overlaps with the quilombola territory. The court affirmed its incompatibility with Article 68 of the Transitional Constitutional Provisions Act (ADCT) and ILO Convention 169, declaring the allocation of that territory to the state park null and void. The decision addressed the concept of environmental racism in the context of climate justice but concluded that the case resulted from a combination of social, environmental, historical, and legal factors. Additionally, the court affirmed that the relationship between traditional communities and the environment is non-conflictual. It acknowledged the urgent need to halt unrestrained human activity in ecosystems—activity that is altering climatic conditions essential for humanity’s survival.\r\n\r\nOn March 5, 2024, the São Paulo State Attorney General's Office filed an appeal against the decision, contextually incorporating the climate argument. It stated that climate change is one of humanity's greatest global threats and emphasized the importance of carbon sinks in sequestering carbon and reducing the accumulation of greenhouse gases (GHG) in the atmosphere. It argued that the solution to the climate challenge lies in simple concepts, such as preserving and restoring green areas, including forests and vegetation cover. The appeal contended that investing in the conservation and sustainable management of green areas is not only an environmental necessity but also a strategic approach to addressing climate challenges and strengthening the resilience of communities (including Quilombolas). It used this argument to advocate for the continued protection of PETAR.\r\n\r\nThe Fundação Florestal and ITESP also filed appeals, but without mentioning climate issues.

The MPF alleges that the defendant's occupation of the land was unlawful, as it is part of an Agroextractivist Settlement Project (Projeto de Assentamento Agroextrativista - PAE), owned by and of interest to the Federal Union, managed by the National Institute for Colonization and Agrarian Reform (INCRA), and occupied by traditional extractivist communities. This ACP is part of a set of 22 actions filed by the MPF following an investigation conducted under Civil Inquiry No. 1.13.000.001719/2015-49, concerning illegal deforestation within the Antimary Agroextractivist Settlement Project (PAE), but involving different defendants. The claims in the action are based, among other points, on Brazilian Environmental Law, particularly the constitutional protection of the environment, allegations of deforestation, strict liability (responsabilidade civil propter rem) for environmental damages—including climate-related damages—and collective moral damages. The claim also identifies unauthorized greenhouse gas emissions resulting from the illegal deforestation as environmental liabilities. These emissions, calculated at 84,681.52 tons of carbon dioxide, are directly linked to Brazil's deviation from its climate goals, conflicting with the country’s national and international commitments under the National Policy on Climate Change (Federal Law No. 12,187/2009) and the Paris Agreement. \r\n\r\nThe relief sought includes, among other requests: \r\n(i) the reversal of the burden of proof ab initio; \r\n(ii) the immediate cessation of activities causing further damage; \r\n(iii) restoration of the environment to its prior condition, or alternatively, in case of non-compliance, payment of compensation aimed at environmental restoration; \r\n(iv) payment of compensation for intermediate and residual environmental material damages; \r\n(v) payment of compensation for climate-related damages; and \r\n(vi) payment of compensation for collective moral damages.\r\n\r\nIn August 2024, a defense was filed requesting the dismissal of the case due to the inadmissibility of the initial petition and contesting the service by publication. On the merits, the defense sought the dismissal of the action. It was argued that the alleged violation was not adequately substantiated, as there was insufficient evidence to establish the defendant's responsibility for the alleged environmental damages, and the causal link—essential for civil liability—was lacking. Additionally, the defense argued that the reparatory and compensatory claims could not be combined, that the amount of compensation for material damages was disproportionate, and that collective moral damages related to the environment should not apply.

      "summary": "In 2016, Ontario, a province in Canada, established a cap-and-trade program for carbon emissions as part of the Western Climate Initiative (WCI), a collaborative effort among regional governments in the United States and Canada to create a shared emissions trading market. During auctions held in 2017 and 2018, KS&T acquired a significant number of emissions trading allowances, transferring the majority of these allowances to California, another participant in the WCI. While the specific value of the allowances is not disclosed in the arbitration award, earlier reports estimate the amount to be approximately USD 30 million, aligning with the claimants' stated damages in the arbitration.\r\n\r\nIn June 2018, a conservative government came to power in Ontario, announcing plans to terminate the cap-and-trade program. This decision included canceling a scheduled auction for additional emissions allowances that month. Subsequently, California ceased recognizing Ontario's emissions allowances, preventing KS&T from transferring certain recently purchased allowances out of Ontario. By October 2018, Ontario formally ended the cap-and-trade program, invalidating existing emissions allowances without providing any compensation to \"market participants,\" including those who had purchased allowances on the secondary market.\r\n\r\nIn December 2020, Koch Industries and KS&T initiated an ICSID arbitration, challenging Ontario's cancellation of their emissions trading allowances under NAFTA. They relied on the “Legacy Investments” provision of the USMCA, as previously discussed in detail.\r\n\r\nAs the Tribunal declined jurisdiction, it did not consider the merits issues. However, it did clarify several issues on international carbon trading emissions which are crucial for the intersection of ISDS and climate change moving forward. We summarize those issues below: \r\n\r\nWhether the emission allowances held by the investor constituted property in Ontario under Article 1139(g) of NAFTA.\r\nCanada argued that the investor´s emissions trading allowances did not qualify as protected investments under NAFTA. The claimants, however, argued that the allowances constituted “property” under NAFTA Article 1139(g), asserting that the term “property” carried an independent and expansive meaning under customary international law. In response, Canada maintained that the allowances lacked essential common-law characteristics of property and that the cap-and-trade program did not demonstrate any intention to create proprietary rights in emissions trading allowances. Citing Lion v. Mexico, the tribunal held that the claimants needed to “prove that the asset over which the claimant alleges property rights is considered as property in that legal system, and that, according to the corresponding laws or rules of that legal system, the property right is vested in the claimant.”\r\n\r\nThe tribunal noted that the cap-and-trade program did not define emissions allowances as property rights and examined whether the allowances met the Ontario common-law definition of property. The tribunal reviewed several Canadian court rulings addressing claims to novel intangible property rights. Ultimately, it found no decision that established a general test for determining the existence of property. Specifically, the tribunal considered: (i) the Saulnier case, (ii) the Anglehart case, (iii) the Tucows case, (iv) the Bouckhuyt case. Synthesizing principles from these cases, the tribunal determined, among others that:\r\n•        Significant government discretion in deciding what constitutes property may negate the exclusivity necessary to establish property rights.\r\n•        Predictability of renewal of emissions trading’s allowances has limited relevance.\r\n•        Government powers to take, modify, or remove statutory rights without compensation, or to exclude expropriation claims, may indicate a lack of “exclusive control” and, therefore, a lack of property rights.\r\n\r\nThe Tribunal ultimately concluded that emissions allowances are not property within are not “property” within the meaning of NAFTA Article 1139(g). The Tribunal’s analysis centered on whether emission allowances under Ontario’s Cap and Trade Act satisfied the “exclusive control” element necessary to constitute property under Ontario law. While the claimants argued that provisions in the Act allowed participants exclusive rights to trade, hold, and use allowances, the Tribunal noted that these provisions were subject to significant government oversight and restrictions. For instance, the government retained broad discretionary powers to regulate allowances, including canceling them, imposing conditions, and limiting their transferability. These powers, alongside statutory limitations on compensation and expropriation claims under Section 70, indicated that the government maintained overarching control over the allowances, undermining the claimants’ assertion of exclusive control. The Tribunal found that this regulatory framework was inconsistent with the degree of autonomy typically required for property under Ontario law.\r\n\r\nThe Tribunal also evaluated Canadian case law, which emphasized exclusivity as the defining characteristic of property. Cases such as Bouckhuyt and Saulnier highlighted that property rights require a significant degree of autonomy and exclusivity, which were lacking in this instance due to the government’s regulatory powers. Although the Tribunal acknowledged that emission allowances exhibited some attributes of property, it ultimately concluded that the claimants failed to demonstrate sufficient control to satisfy the exclusivity element. Therefore, the Tribunal found that the emission allowances did not constitute property under Ontario law and, consequently, did not qualify as an investment under Article 1139(g) of NAFTA. This decision underscores the challenges of asserting property rights in regulatory frameworks designed to address climate and environmental objectives.\r\n\r\nWhether cross-border emission trading activities are classified as an economic activity under Article 1139(h).\r\n\r\nThe claimants sought to characterize the emissions allowances and their trading business as “interests arising from the commitment of capital or other resources in the territory of a Party to economic activity in such territory,” within the meaning of NAFTA Article 1139(h). In contrast, the respondent contended that respondents’ interests did not meet the requirements of Article 1139(h) and failed to align with the illustrative examples provided in the provision, which emphasize contracts involving property or economic activity directly tied to the host state. Notably, the Tribunal emphasized that the claimants needed to show “a cognizable interest that results from committing those resources within the territory of a Party towards economic activity within that territory,” meaning economic activity in Ontario specifically.\r\n\r\nThe tribunal further held that the claimant’s emissions allowances did not provide it with a legal share in any asset or resource, and therefore, did not constitute a qualifying interest. Moreover, the Tribunal noted that the trading activities—purchasing allowances in auctions and reselling them in secondary markets—did not align with the types of interests described in the Article 1139(h) examples, as the Claimant did not operate an enterprise in Ontario. Additionally, the tribunal observed that the Claimant lacked any physical or corporate presence, or economic activity, in Ontario, apart from employing a local representative to satisfy regulatory obligations. Its trading operations were conducted entirely from the United States, and there was “no evidence that KS&T’s trading business was linked to a specific underlying economic project, operation, or activity taking place in Ontario.” As in Apotex v. USA and Canadian Cattlemen v. USA, the tribunal concluded that the Claimant’s cross-border trading activities through auctions and transfers of emissions allowances did not qualify as protected investments.\r\n\r\nConclusion \r\n\r\nOn this basis, the Tribunal held that it lacked jurisdiction over the claims filed by Claimants, Koch Industries, Inc. and Koch Supply & Trading, LP, against Respondent, Canada, and that each Party shall bear its own costs, fees, and expenses.",

The law came into force on January 1, 2025, and aims to terminate the sectoral agreement known as the \"Soy Moratorium,\" recognized as one of the most successful programs reconciling the development of large-scale agricultural production with environmental sustainability. This agreement regulates the granting of tax incentives and the allocation of public land to agribusiness companies with internal purchasing policies to avoid acquiring agricultural goods (soy, corn, cattle, etc.) produced in recently deforested areas. The plaintiffs argue that, regarding formal unconstitutionality, the matter falls under the exclusive initiative of the Executive Branch. As for material unconstitutionality, they claim that the law penalizes legal entities that adopt sustainable purchasing policies and favors suppliers that promote the destruction of the Amazon Rainforest, which would violate the principles of equality and free enterprise enshrined in the Federal Constitution. It was also emphasized that this law violates the protection of acquired rights, perfected legal acts, the defense of the environment as a fundamental principle of the national tax system, the right to an ecologically balanced environment, the duty to protect the environment, and the principle of prohibiting setbacks in environmental protection. It was highlighted that this law represents a setback in the fight against climate change, considering the commitments made under the Declaration of the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the Kyoto Protocol, and the Paris Agreement, which hold supralegal status. The plaintiffs requested, as part of the preliminary injunction, the granting of the requested precautionary measure to suspend the effects of the aforementioned articles of Law 12,709/2024 of the State of Mato Grosso. In the final judgment, they seek a ruling in favor of the ADI to declare the unconstitutionality of the aforementioned articles of the Law.\r\n\r\nIn a preliminary decision, the Reporting Justice found that the legal plausibility of the request for urgent relief had been demonstrated and granted the precautionary measure to suspend the effectiveness of State Law 12,709/2024.",

The lawsuit challenges the irregular hiring of a private company for the commercialization of carbon credits in conservation units in the Baixo Rio Branco region of Roraima. The plaintiff alleges the lack of public participation in the hiring process and, in particular, the absence of prior consultation with the traditional communities that inhabit the region and contribute to its preservation. It is further claimed that there was no proper benefit-sharing from the carbon credits generated, disregarding the rights of these populations. Other alleged irregularities include lack of transparency and favoritism in the bidding process, resulting in environmental and social harm. The lawsuit emphasizes that the actions in question violate administrative morality, the rights of local populations, and environmental balance. As part of the preliminary injunction, the plaintiff requests the immediate suspension of the contracts and activities resulting from the public call, to prevent irreversible damage. On the merits, the plaintiff seeks: (i) annulment of the contracts and the public call; (ii) conducting a new administrative procedure with the participation of traditional communities and the implementation of benefit-sharing mechanisms; and (iii) compensation for the environmental and social damages caused.\r\n\r\nThe case highlights the importance of adhering to principles of transparency, public participation, and respect for the rights of traditional communities in environmental and carbon credit projects.",

It seeks to recognize the Rio Doce River Basin as a subject of rights and hold the Federal Government and the State of Minas Gerais responsible for omissions in disaster prevention measures. The disaster contaminated the Rio Doce with 62 million cubic meters of iron ore sludge, causing damage to its ecosystem and its riverside populations. The plaintiff argues that the National Climate Change Policy (PNMC) and the National Civil Protection and Defense Policy (Law 12.608/2012) were not complied with, which actively contributed to the socio-environmental disaster. It claims that the PNMC obliges the state to make economic and social development compatible with the protection of the climate system, and that the National Plan for Adaptation to Climate Change (PNA) pointed out flaws in the implementation of the PNMC, especially with regard to the failure to establish a national register of municipalities with areas susceptible to disasters and to draw up a State Civil Protection and Defense Plan. These would be important instruments for guaranteeing the protection of river basins and preventing future disasters. Thus, the state's failure to fulfill its obligations to prevent disasters under the Law of the Sea, Climate Law and Disaster Law must be remedied. The case seeks that the Rio Doce River Basin be recognized as a subject of rights; that all people be granted broad legal standing to defend the Rio Doce River Basin's right to healthy existence; that the Federal Union and the state of Minas Gerais be ordered to set up a national register of municipalities with areas susceptible to disasters and that a Disaster Prevention Plan be drawn up for Minas Gerais, with the participation of representatives from academic institutions and riverside peoples.\r\n\r\nIn September 2018, a decision was held and the case was dismissed for lack of active legitimacy due to the lack of legal personality of the Rio Doce River Basin.

The author says that the municipality has been progressively incorporated into the Tapajós-Xingu Logistics Corridor, which includes commodity export corridors in the Madeira and Tocantins river basins and involves the implementation of various infrastructure projects with social and environmental risks. The lack of impact studies has caused serious environmental and social damage, such as deforestation, water pollution, loss of biodiversity, destruction of ecosystems and a threat to the livelihoods of traditional communities, including indigenous peoples, quilombolas, artisanal fishermen, riverine communities and extractive communities. The plaintiff argues that the operation of multiple ports in the same region can generate cumulative and synergistic effects, increasing pressure on the climate, and that it is essential to consider the assessment of the climate dimension of possible impacts in the environmental licensing of projects. It therefore requests that the State of Pará and the Municipality of Santarém be ordered to adapt their environmental licensing procedures for port and waterway works in Santarém/PA, with a mandatory prior environmental impact study (EIA/RIMA), a study of quilombola (ECG) and indigenous (ECI) components, a climate impact study and free, prior and informed consultation of the traditional peoples and communities potentially impacted.

      "count": 1,
      "summary": "The dispute arose from regulatory changes in Spain’s renewable energy framework that affected the investments of German companies BayWa r.e. Renewable Energy GmbH and BayWa r.e. Asset Holding GmbH (collectively, \"\"BayWa\"\"). BayWa had acquired interests in two Spanish special purpose vehicles (SPVs), Parque Eólico La Carracha, S.L. and Parque Eólico Plana de Jarreta, S.L., which owned and managed wind farms in northern Spain.\r\n\r\nFollowing Spain’s 2013/2014 regulatory reforms, which included a clawback provision impacting subsidies, BayWa initiated arbitration under the Energy Charter Treaty (ECT). The tribunal dismissed most of BayWa’s primary claims but found that Spain had violated Article 10(1) of the ECT due to the instability caused by the clawback measure.\r\n\r\nDuring the proceedings, the tribunal rejected three attempts by the European Commission (EC) to intervene, concluding that its submissions did not add distinct legal arguments beyond Spain’s position. The tribunal also dismissed most of Spain’s jurisdictional objections, including an intra-EU objection, but upheld the tax carve-out exception.\r\n\r\nOn January 25, 2021, the tribunal awarded BayWa approximately $22 million USD plus interest. Spain later applied for annulment of the award.\r\n\r\n\r\nJurisdiction:\r\nThe Tribunal rejected Spain’s intra-EU objection, affirming that the Energy Charter Treaty (ECT) applied among EU Member States before and after the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU). It found no exclusion clause in the ECT and ruled that EU law did not override it under the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties (VCLT). Distinguishing Achmea, which addressed a bilateral treaty, the Tribunal held that its jurisdiction remained valid since the ECT is a multilateral treaty to which the EU itself is a party.\r\n\r\nThe Tribunal ruled that the TVPEE (Tax on the Value of the Production of Electrical Energy) is a taxation measure and falls outside its jurisdiction under Article 21.1 of the Energy Charter Treaty (ECT), aligning with previous tribunal decisions. Introduced under Law 15/2012, the TVPEE imposes a 7% tax on total revenue from electricity production, aiming to raise funds for the state and promote energy efficiency and environmental sustainability. The Tribunal found that the TVPEE meets the definition of a tax as a compulsory exaction for public purposes, a classification upheld by Spanish courts, including the High Court and Constitutional Court. It rejected the Claimants’ argument that a tax must be enacted in good faith to qualify under Article 21.1, noting no evidence of bad faith in Spain’s adoption of the TVPEE. The Tribunal also dismissed the Claimants’ attempt to invoke investment protections via Article 21.3, ruling that the TVPEE qualifies as a tax on income under Article 21.7.b, thereby excluding the application of the Most-Favored Nation (MFN) clause. Consequently, the claim was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nMerits:  \r\nThe Tribunal concluded, by majority, that Spain did not generally breach the Fair and Equitable Treatment (FET) standard under Article 10.1 of the ECT, though it found a limited breach concerning the clawback of subsidies. It noted that investment was made amid economic difficulties, that Spain had made no specific binding commitments to investors, and that non-discriminatory regulatory changes were expected risks. While some Disputed Measures (2013-14) were criticized, a substantial support system remained, including priority access and a 7.98% IRR for wind power. The Tribunal acknowledged that Special Regime subsidies were unnotified state aid under EU law, making them legally vulnerable. However, the European Commission never declared them unlawful or required recovery. Ultimately, the Tribunal ruled that Spain's clawback of previously paid subsidies breached the ECT’s obligation of stability, but other regulatory changes did not constitute unfair treatment. Arbitrator Grigera Naón dissented, and the Tribunal proceeded to assess quantum.\r\n\r\nConclusion:\r\nConclusively, on January 25, 2021, the Tribunal awarded BayWa approximately 22 million USD, plus interest. This decision was further challenged by Spain before an ICSID Annulment Committee. \r\n\r\nPost Award Proceedings:\r\nThe ICSID ad hoc committee dismissed Spain’s application to annul the tribunal’s award in BayWa v. Spain, rejecting claims of manifest excess of powers and procedural violations. The committee emphasized that annulment is not an appeal and found no egregious error in the tribunal’s decision to uphold jurisdiction over the intra-EU dispute, nor in its rejection of the Achmea ruling as inapplicable to the Energy Charter Treaty (ECT). It also upheld the tribunal’s discretion in refusing the European Commission’s amicus curiae request, as the Commission’s arguments mirrored Spain’s position and had been well covered in prior case law. Spain was ordered to bear all annulment costs and 85% of the claimants’ legal fees, with interest accruing at 4.5% annually after a 60-day grace period.",

      "summary": "The dispute concerns the Keystone XL Pipeline, a project intended to transport crude oil from Alberta, Canada, to U.S. refineries. The project, partly financed by Alberta Petroleum Marketing Commission (APMC), faced repeated setbacks due to shifting U.S. political decisions. The initial Presidential Permit application (2008) was denied in 2012, prompting a second application, which was also rejected under the Obama administration, leading to an ICSID Arbitration between the parties. However, after the Trump administration approved the permit in 2017, the parties terminated the arbitration and waived future claims related to prior events. The permit was reissued in 2019 but was revoked in January 2021 after President Biden took office. With NAFTA replaced by USMCA in July 2020—and Canada opting out of investor-state arbitration—the claimants initiated a new arbitration in November 2021 under Annex 14-C of the USMCA as a NAFTA legacy claim.\r\n\r\nThe jurisdictional arguments in TC Energy & TransCanada v. United States (2) focused on whether Annex 14-C of the USMCA allowed claims for breaches occurring after NAFTA’s termination on June 30, 2020, but within the three-year transition period (July 1, 2020 – June 30, 2023). The claimants argued for an expansive interpretation, asserting that Annex 14-C permitted claims based on breaches occurring during the transition period as long as they were filed before June 30, 2023. They maintained that the ordinary meaning of Annex 14-C, its explicit reference to NAFTA Chapter 11, and the principle of good faith supported their position. Additionally, the claimants invoked estoppel and unclean hands, arguing that the United States had induced them to withdraw an earlier NAFTA claim with the promise of a Presidential Permit, only to later revoke it.\r\n\r\nIn contrast, the United States (respondent) argued for a restrictive interpretation, contending that only breaches occurring before NAFTA’s termination could be arbitrated under Annex 14-C. The U.S. maintained that NAFTA’s substantive protections expired on June 30, 2020, and that the transition period merely extended the dispute resolution mechanism, not the underlying obligations. The U.S. also relied on international law principles, particularly Article 70 of the VCLT, which states that once a treaty is terminated, its obligations no longer apply unless expressly preserved. The U.S. further emphasized that allowing claims for post-2020 breaches would conflict with the USMCA's purpose of replacing NAFTA and create uncertainty over applicable legal standards.\r\n\r\nThe tribunal majority (Mourre & Crook) upheld the restrictive interpretation and declined jurisdiction, ruling that Annex 14-C only preserved the arbitration mechanism, not NAFTA’s substantive protections. The majority based its decision on several key findings:\r\n\r\n1.\tOrdinary treaty interpretation (VCLT Article 31) indicated that NAFTA’s substantive obligations ended on June 30, 2020, and only the arbitration process was temporarily extended.\r\n2.\tContextual evidence, including footnotes in Annex 14-C and other USMCA provisions, confirmed that no provision extended NAFTA’s investment protections beyond its termination date.\r\n3.\tTreaty termination rules (VCLT Article 70) supported the conclusion that a treaty’s substantive provisions do not survive termination unless expressly stated.\r\n4.\tGood faith and estoppel arguments were rejected, as the tribunal found no evidence that the U.S. had misled the claimants into believing that NAFTA’s protections would continue post-2020.\r\n\r\nIn dissent, Arbitrator Alvarez argued for the expansive interpretation, stating that Annex 14-C’s reference to NAFTA Chapter 11 implied that its substantive protections should remain in force throughout the transition period. He maintained that the ordinary meaning of the treaty text, footnotes in Annex 14-C, and negotiation history supported the claimants' position. He also criticized the majority’s ruling for adding a condition not found in the treaty text, arguing that NAFTA’s investment protections should have applied for the full three-year transition period.\r\nUltimately, the tribunal declined jurisdiction over the claim, ruling that breaches occurring after NAFTA’s termination were not covered under Annex 14-C. The claimants were ordered to pay the arbitration costs, marking a significant decision on the scope of NAFTA legacy claims under the USMCA.\r\n\r\nMerits:\r\nThe Tribunal did not analyze the merits of the case as it declined jurisdiction to hear the case based on the reasons above set.\r\n\r\nConclusion:\r\nUltimately, the tribunal majority upheld the restrictive view, ruling that Annex 14-C preserved only NAFTA’s arbitration mechanism, not its substantive protections. A dissenting opinion, however, supported the expansive view, arguing that NAFTA’s investment protections should have applied throughout the transition period.",

      "type": "case",
      "count": 1,
      "summary": "Windstream Energy LLC, a U.S.-based renewable energy company, secured a contract under Ontario’s Feed-in-Tariff (FIT) Program in 2010 to develop a 300-megawatt offshore wind energy project near Wolfe Island in Lake Ontario. The FIT Program was designed to promote renewable energy investment by guaranteeing long-term, fixed-premium pricing for electricity sold to the Ontario grid. Windstream’s contract, awarded by the Ontario Power Authority (OPA), required the company to bring its project into commercial operation by May 4, 2015.\r\n\r\nIn February 2011, the Government of Ontario imposed a moratorium on offshore wind projects, citing the need for further scientific research on their environmental impact. This decision significantly impacted Windstream’s ability to proceed with its project, as it prevented necessary testing and created regulatory uncertainty. Windstream contended that this moratorium rendered its project unfinanceable and worthless, given that investors were unwilling to support a project with such high regulatory risks. The company initiated arbitration under NAFTA Chapter 11, seeking CAD 475 million in damages, arguing that Canada had violated its obligations under the treaty by failing to provide fair and equitable treatment, by discriminating against Windstream in favor of other energy developers, and by effectively expropriating its investment.\r\n\r\nCanada countered that the moratorium was a necessary and legitimate policy decision based on scientific concerns. It further argued that Windstream had not suffered actual expropriation, as the FIT contract remained legally in force and the company’s CAD 6 million security deposit was still recoverable. Canada also maintained that Windstream was not treated unfairly or discriminatorily, as the moratorium applied to all offshore wind developers equally.\r\n\r\nJurisdiction:\r\nThe tribunal, constituted under the UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, had jurisdiction under NAFTA Chapter 11, which governs disputes between foreign investors and host states. A key jurisdictional issue was whether the actions of the Ontario Power Authority (OPA), an entity responsible for energy contracts in the province, could be attributed to Canada. Initially, the tribunal reserved judgment on this issue, intending to address it during the merits phase. Ultimately, however, it found this question moot, as the breach of NAFTA was attributed to the Ontario government’s conduct rather than any actions of the OPA. This determination allowed the tribunal to focus on whether Ontario’s regulatory decisions violated NAFTA’s investment protection standards.\r\n\r\nMerits, Damages and Costs:\r\nOn the claim of expropriation under Article 1110, the tribunal ruled against Windstream. It found that there had been no indirect expropriation because the FIT contract was still in effect, meaning Windstream retained the legal right to develop the project if the moratorium were lifted. Furthermore, the CAD 6 million security deposit remained intact and could still be recovered, undermining Windstream’s claim that its investment had been entirely deprived of value. As a result, the tribunal concluded that Windstream had not suffered a substantial deprivation of its investment, a necessary condition for establishing expropriation.\r\n\r\nOn the claim of minimum standard of treatment under Article 1105, the tribunal found that while Ontario’s decision to impose the moratorium itself was not wrongful, its failure to clarify the regulatory uncertainty surrounding offshore wind development constituted a breach of NAFTA. The tribunal noted that although the government cited scientific uncertainty as justification for the moratorium, it failed to follow through with sufficient research to resolve those concerns. Moreover, Ontario did not take adequate steps to address the legal and contractual limbo in which Windstream found itself after the moratorium. Instead of either completing the necessary studies to develop a regulatory framework or formally terminating Windstream’s contract under the law, the government left the project in an indefinite state of uncertainty. The tribunal ruled that this failure to act was unfair and inequitable, violating NAFTA’s fair and equitable treatment standard.\r\n\r\nOn the claim of discrimination under Articles 1102 and 1103, the tribunal rejected Windstream’s argument that it had been treated less favorably than other energy developers, such as TransCanada and Samsung. The tribunal found that these companies’ projects were not offshore wind projects and thus were not in “like circumstances” with Windstream. Additionally, other offshore wind developers had received even worse treatment than Windstream, as their projects were outright canceled. Consequently, the tribunal dismissed Windstream’s discrimination claim.\r\n\r\nIn determining compensation, the tribunal rejected Windstream’s proposed valuation using the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) method, which is typically used for projects with an established revenue stream. Instead, it adopted a comparable transactions methodology, assessing the value of similar offshore wind projects in Europe. Based on this approach, the tribunal valued Windstream’s investment at EUR 21 million (CAD 31.2 million) but deducted CAD 6 million to account for the recoverable security deposit. This resulted in a final damages award of CAD 25.2 million.\r\n\r\nThe tribunal also awarded CAD 2.9 million in legal costs to Windstream, requiring Canada to cover 50% of the company’s legal expenses. However, it declined to award pre-award or post-award interest, reasoning that Canada was expected to comply with the ruling promptly. In 2017, the Government of Ontario fully satisfied the award, bringing the dispute to a close.\r\n\r\nConclusion:\r\nThe tribunal found that Canada breached NAFTA Article 1105 by failing to clarify the regulatory uncertainty caused by Ontario’s moratorium on offshore wind projects. However, it dismissed claims of expropriation (Article 1110) and discrimination (Articles 1102 & 1103), ruling that Windstream had not been substantially deprived of its investment and was not in “like circumstances” with favored energy developers.\r\nAs a remedy, the tribunal awarded CAD 25.2 million in damages and CAD 2.9 million in legal costs to Windstream but denied pre-award or post-award interest. The Government of Ontario fully complied with the ruling, settling the award in 2017.",

      "summary": "In 2011, Antin Infrastructure Services Luxembourg S.À.R.L. and Antin Energia Termosolar B.V. invested in Spain’s renewable energy sector by acquiring a 45% stake in two concentrated solar power (CSP) plants, Andasol-1 and Andasol-2, located in Granada. At the time of their investment, Spain had a regulatory framework under Royal Decree 661/2007 (RD661/2007), which guaranteed a stable Feed-in Tariff (FiT) for the lifetime of renewable energy installations. This policy was designed to attract foreign investment and provide financial security for renewable energy projects. Antin conducted extensive due diligence through legal, financial, and technical experts, confirming that Spain’s regulatory framework was stable and supportive of CSP projects.\r\n\r\nBeginning in 2012, Spain implemented significant reforms in the renewable energy sector, citing concerns over the sustainability of its subsidy program. The first major regulatory change was Law 15/2012, which introduced a tax on the value of electricity production (TVPEE) and excluded CSP plants using natural gas from the FiT scheme. This was followed by Royal Decree-Law 2/2013 and Royal Decree-Law 9/2013, which abolished the FiT scheme entirely and replaced it with a new “special payment” mechanism. This new scheme was based on a reasonable rate of return rather than a guaranteed price, drastically altering the economic conditions under which Antin had made its investment. Antin argued that these regulatory changes wiped out the fundamental incentives that had made their investment viable.\r\n\r\nIn late 2013, Antin initiated arbitration under the Energy Charter Treaty (ECT), Article 10(1), arguing that Spain’s regulatory overhaul, among others, violated the Fair and Equitable Treatment (FET) standard by eliminating key regulatory protections; breached investors’ legitimate expectations, as Spain had repeatedly assured regulatory stability. Antin argued that this deprived Antin of the economic value of its investment, amounting to an effective expropriation.\r\n\r\nThe tribunal rejected Spain’s intra-EU objection, following previous Charanne, Isolux, and Eiser cases, which had confirmed that intra-EU disputes under the ECT were valid. It further ruled that Antin had a protected investment under the ECT, as its shareholding in the CSP plants constituted a qualifying investment. However, regarding the TVPEE tax, the tribunal upheld Spain’s objection, ruling that taxation measures were exempt from ECT jurisdiction under its tax carve-out provision.\r\n\r\nFollowing the tribunal’s acceptance of jurisdiction over most of Antin’s claims, the case proceeded to the merits and damages phase, ultimately leading to an award in favor of Antin.\r\n\r\nMerits:\r\nI.\tBreach of the Fair and Equitable Treatment (FET) Standard\r\nThe tribunal found that Spain violated the Fair and Equitable Treatment (FET) obligation under Article 10(1) of ECT. The key issue was whether Spain’s regulatory changes eliminated the essential features of the legal framework that investors had relied upon when making long-term investments in the CSP sector. The tribunal held that while states retain the right to regulate, they must do so in a manner that respects investors’ legitimate expectations and does not create legal instability.\r\nAntin successfully demonstrated that Spain had repeatedly assured investors that its regulatory framework for renewable energy would remain stable. These assurances were conveyed through laws, official statements, policy documents, and promotional materials. The tribunal ruled that Spain’s drastic regulatory changes, particularly the elimination of the Feed-in Tariff (FiT) system and its replacement with a less favorable compensation scheme, undermined investor confidence and violated the FET standard.\r\n\r\nII.\tLegitimate Expectations and Regulatory Stability\r\nThe tribunal emphasized that investors’ legitimate expectations must be based on objective criteria. In this case, Antin had relied on Spain’s explicit commitments when making its investment. The tribunal noted that Spain had actively promoted the stability of its renewable energy regime, and that the elimination of the original incentive structure effectively deprived investors of the financial benefits they had anticipated.\r\nSpain argued that regulatory changes were necessary to address its growing tariff deficit and to ensure the sustainability of the energy sector. However, the tribunal was not convinced that CSP plants like Andasol-1 and Andasol-2 significantly contributed to the tariff deficit. Moreover, the new regulatory framework lacked identifiable criteria for determining the revised compensation, making it unpredictable and arbitrary.\r\n\r\nIII.\tRejection of Spain’s Key Defenses\r\nSpain attempted to defend its actions by arguing that:\r\n1.\tRegulatory changes were necessary for economic and public policy reasons.\r\n2.\tInvestors should have only expected a “reasonable return”, not a fixed tariff.\r\n3.\tThe changes did not eliminate all economic benefits, as the new regime still provided compensation.\r\nThe tribunal rejected these arguments, stating that the issue was not whether a reasonable return existed, but whether the new system upheld the principles of stability and predictability. It found that Spain had eliminated key features of the previous regime, thus breaching the FET standard.\r\n\r\nDamages and Compensation Awarded:\r\nThe tribunal awarded Antin EUR 112 million in compensation, based on a discounted cash flow (DCF) valuation of future lost profits. Spain had opposed the use of the DCF method, arguing that it was too speculative. However, the tribunal upheld the DCF approach, noting that the unpredictability stemmed from Spain’s own regulatory changes, not from flaws in the valuation method.\r\nAdditionally, the tribunal awarded:\r\n•\tPre- and post-award interest at 2.07%, compounded monthly.\r\n•\t60% of Antin’s legal costs and arbitration expenses, given that Spain’s regulatory actions had forced Antin to seek legal recourse.\r\nAntin had also sought:\r\n•\tA “tax gross-up” to offset potential Luxembourg corporate taxes, which the tribunal denied due to lack of evidence on the actual tax impact.\r\n•\tCompensation for historic losses prior to the complete regulatory overhaul, which the tribunal also denied, ruling that the damages should be calculated from the time the original regulatory framework was fully dismantled in 2014.\r\nThe tribunal’s decision reaffirmed that states cannot drastically alter regulatory regimes in ways that fundamentally undermine investor expectations without breaching international investment law. Spain was held liable for failing to ensure stability, predictability, and fairness in its treatment of investors. However, the tribunal limited damages to the actual financial harm caused after the final regulatory changes took effect, rejecting additional claims for indirect losses and tax adjustments.\r\nIn conclusion, the tribunal found that Canada breached NAFTA Article 1105 by failing to clarify the regulatory uncertainty caused by Ontario’s moratorium on offshore wind projects. However, it dismissed claims of expropriation (Article 1110) and discrimination (Articles 1102 & 1103), ruling that Windstream had not been substantially deprived of its investment and was not in “like circumstances” with favored energy developers.\r\nAs a remedy, the tribunal awarded CAD 25.2 million in damages and CAD 2.9 million in legal costs to Windstream but denied pre-award or post-award interest. The Government of Ontario fully complied with the ruling, settling the award in 2017.\r\n\r\nPost Award Proceedings- Annulment \r\n\r\nI.\tRectification of the Award\r\nThe Tribunal rectified its award after Spain submitted a request under Article 49(2) of the ICSID Convention, alleging clerical errors in the damages calculation. Spain claimed that the Tribunal mistakenly included EUR 28 million in the awarded sum due to an error in referencing figures from the expert reports. The Claimants agreed that an error had occurred but asserted that the correct amount to be deducted was EUR 11 million rather than 28 million. The Tribunal analyzed the dispute and determined that the actual error stemmed from the Tribunal’s incorrect reference to total claim figures, which led to an overstatement of the awarded damages. Consequently, the Tribunal rectified the amount in paragraph 725 of the Award, reducing the compensation from EUR 112 million to EUR 101 million.\r\nBeyond this specific correction, the Tribunal dismissed Spain’s broader claims for rectification. Spain had argued that additional rectifications were necessary regarding the methodology used for calculating damages, particularly concerning the estimated lifetime of the power plants, which affected the compensation amount. However, the Tribunal found that Spain’s argument went beyond the scope of rectification proceedings, as defined under Article 49(2), which is strictly limited to correcting clerical, arithmetical, or similar errors. The Tribunal also rejected Spain’s request to adjust the allocation of costs, holding that Spain had not demonstrated any specific error warranting rectification. Ultimately, the Tribunal confirmed the corrected compensation amount of EUR 101 million but refused to modify its findings on methodology or cost allocation.\r\n\r\nII.\tICSID Decision on Annulment \r\nThe ad hoc Committee rejected Spain’s application for annulment of the ICSID arbitral award in Infrastructure Services Luxembourg S.À.R.L. and Energia Termosolar B.V. v. Kingdom of Spain (ICSID Case No. ARB/13/31). Spain had advanced multiple grounds for annulment, arguing that the tribunal had manifestly exceeded its powers, seriously departed from a fundamental rule of procedure, and failed to state the reasons for its conclusions. The Committee reaffirmed that annulment is not an appeal process and does not allow a de novo review of the tribunal’s factual or legal findings. It concluded that Spain’s objections did not meet the high threshold required for annulment under Article 52 of the ICSID Convention, as the tribunal had provided sufficient reasoning and had not committed any manifest excess of power.\r\nSpain had also contended that the tribunal had wrongly refused to admit certain key documents, such as the Achmea decision and the European Commission's Decision 7384 on state aid, arguing that this constituted a serious departure from fundamental procedural rules. However, the Committee found that Spain had been given a full opportunity to present its case, and that the exclusion of these documents did not amount to a fundamental procedural breach. The Committee further held that the tribunal’s jurisdictional reasoning regarding intra-EU disputes under the Energy Charter Treaty was comprehensible and aligned with prior arbitral decisions, rejecting Spain’s claim that the tribunal had failed to state reasons. Accordingly, the Committee upheld the finality of the arbitral award and ordered Spain to bear the full costs of the annulment proceedings, including €2,310,379.38 in legal fees and expenses.",

It is informed that this lawsuit concerns a forest, the removal of which began in January 2025, which has existed since the 1950s and consists of approximately one hundred mature and large-sized trees, home to various bird species, and potentially containing a water spring within the property located in a private area in the Perdizes neighborhood in São Paulo. This forest is purportedly protected as it includes a Permanent Preservation Area (APP) and Permanent Preservation Vegetation (VPP), in addition to being situated on land geomorphologically classified as a drainage headwater, which is highly susceptible to landslides, erosion, and flooding. It is emphasized that in the context of climate change, flooding becomes much more likely, further underscoring the importance of preserving the area. Urban regulations are cited, which mention the need for cities to adapt in light of climate change. The request is made for the granting of preliminary injunctive relief, to: (i) impose on the developer the immediate cessation of tree removal, continuation of any construction work on the site, earthmoving, deposition of construction materials, or other activities aimed at the construction of Sales Stands or similar structures, under penalty of a daily fine; (ii) suspend the Permit issued by the Municipality, as well as the Term of Adjustment of Conduct (TAC) executed for the intervention at the site; and (iii) impose on the Municipality the obligation to reassess the authorization, taking into account the discrepancies pointed out in the technical opinion of CAEX-MPSP regarding the level of protection of the area.\r\n\r\nIn January 2025, the judge granted the injunction.",

      "summary": "In January 2021, the Public Prosecutor's Office of the State of Mato Grosso (MPMT) filed a Public Civil Action (CPA), with a request for an injunction, against Joel Rubin, seeking compensation for material and moral damages resulting from the deforestation of 296.2541 hectares in a Legal Reserve (RL) area on Fazenda Silva I, located in the municipality of Nova Maringá, in Mato Grosso. The deforestation occurred without authorization from the environmental agency between 2015 and 2018. It is mentioned that the damage caused by the emission of greenhouse gases resulting from deforestation violates the provisions of the National Policy on Climate Change (Federal Law 12.187/2009) and the State Policy on Climate Change (State Law 582/2017), contributing to global climate change. It is argued that the Brazilian legal system enshrines the principle of preserving climate integrity and warns of the intensification of global warming effects. It is alleged that environmental civil liability is strict, and the obligation to repair is propter rem. In the preliminary injunction, the plaintiff requests, among other measures, the prohibition of economic use of the area during the litigation, the restoration of the degraded or altered area, the suspension of financing, tax incentives, and access to credit lines, and the registration of the CPA  in the property’s deed. As a final request, the plaintiff seeks compensation for material environmental damages, estimated at R$ 12,169,649.70, and for moral damages, to be determined by the court.\r\n\r\nIn January 2021, the court partially granted the urgent injunctive relief, limiting it to the registration of the lawsuit in the property’s deed.\r\n\r\nIn September 2021, the defendant filed his response arguing that the property where the deforestation occurred was sold by him in 2017 to Milton Paulo Cella and, therefore, he is not the party responsible for the deforestation nor the proper party to be named as the defendant in the lawsuit. On the merits, the defendant requested the total dismissal of the plaintiff’s claims. He argued in favor of restoration of the area over the payment of compensation, the impossibility of cumulating compensation for material and moral damages, and the absence of moral damages.\r\n\r\nIn its reply, the MPMT requested the amendment of the initial complaint to include Milton Paulo Cella and Diogo Ricardo Bavaresco as defendants, as they acquired the deforested area, which was accepted by the defendant.\r\n\r\nDue to the connection of this lawsuit with others pending against the defendant in the Federal Court of the First Region, the case was transferred to the Federal Court under case number 1002350-88.2024.4.01.3604.",

The company planned to restart operations using a more labour-intensive bord and pillar mining method but claimed it was unable to achieve necessary operational flexibility under the existing agreement. The Construction, Forestry, Maritime, Mining and Energy Union (CFMMEU) opposed the termination, asserting it would negatively impact former employees who expected re-employment under the agreement and could set a precedent lowering regional industry standards.\r\n\r\nOn Aoril 7, 2020, Commissioner Riordan dismissed Wollongong Coal’s termination application, concluding that the termination was not clearly in the public interest, given uncertain employment benefits and potential negative impacts on regional wages. Riordan also highlighted past compliance concerns with Wollongong Coal’s financial and employment obligations. The company appealed, arguing errors in the decision-making process, notably that speculative negative outcomes were improperly weighted, and that the Commission failed to properly assess the importance of termination for reopening the mine.\r\n\r\nOn 24 September 2020, a Full Bench of the Fair Work Commission upheld Wollongong Coal’s appeal. The Bench found the original decision contained significant errors in applying the legislative criteria under section 226, including improperly emphasizing speculative regional wage outcomes while inadequately evaluating the operational and financial necessity for terminating the agreement. Climate change issues, though briefly mentioned during the original proceedings, were explicitly considered not to be relevant to the Commission’s decision-making process, as policy on climate change and coal mining is a matter for government. The Full Bench quashed the initial decision and ordered a rehearing to properly determine if terminating the enterprise agreement was appropriate under all relevant circumstances.",

The Claimants filed a claim against the Czech Republic concerning alleged violations of the Energy Charter Treaty (ECT) and the bilateral investment treaty between Germany and the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic, signed on October 2, 1990. Specifically, they argued that legislative changes made by the Respondent—specifically, measures introduced by the Czech government to address the financial burden caused by the solar energy boom—negatively impacted their investments in photovoltaic power plants. These changes included the implementation of the Solar Levy, which was a tax imposed on solar installations receiving excessive feed-in tariffs (FiTs), and the removal of the 5% cap on the reduction of FiTs for solar plants connected to the grid from 2011 onward. The Respondent argued these changes were necessary due to - among other things - concernd over state aid rules under EU law.\r\n\r\nConsequently, the Claimants requesed that the Tribunal issued a declaration stating that the Respondent's actions constitute unfair treatment in violation of the ECT and the German BIT; they also sought compensation for losses incurred due to these breaches.

This lawsuit is part of a set of 6 environmental class-action filed against the 4th Bid Cycle for oil exploration blocks. The aim is to challenge the auction of oil exploration blocks located in the Sergipe-Alagoas and Potiguar Basins. The plaintiff argues that the inclusion of this set of blocks is illegal as it overlaps with Conservation Units (Brazilian Protected areas), buffer zones, environmental protection areas and extractive reserves. The plaintiff state that the climate emergency scenario requires an energy transition towards clean energies and a reduction in GHG emissions, which is incompatible with the expansion of oil exploration. As a preliminary injunction, it is requested that the offer in the 4th Permanent Offer Cycle of the blocks in the Sergipe-Alagoas and Potiguar Basins be suspended until the technical analysis that demonstrates the socio-environmental viability is carried out. On a definitive basis, they request that the contested blocks be excluded from the Bid Cycle. \r\n\r\nIn June 2024, ANP presented its defense. According to the Agency, the bidding procedure was carried out regularly and judicial discussion of the issue violates the principle of the separation of powers and enters into the discretionary judgment of the executive branch. As for climate protection, it said that the NetZero 2050 scenario still envisages oil and gas as primary energy sources, used with mitigated or neutralized emissions.\r\n\r\nIn June 2024, the Federal Government filed its defense. The government argued that the procedure was regularly structured, that there was no overlap with buffer zones, that the executive branch's discretion could not be subject to judicial control and that there were no environmental obstacles, stressing that the environmental licensing procedure would define any impacts in depth. It requested that the case be dismissed on the grounds of lack of procedural interest or active illegitimacy and, in the alternative, that the claims be recognized as unfounded.\r\n\r\nIn July 2024, company 3R RNCE S.A. also filed a defense requesting that the lawsuit be dismissed. According to the company, the bidding cycle is regular and assessments of environmental impacts at this time are premature and that any impacts will be assessed in the environmental licensing required for any oil exploration and production activity. Furthermore, it argued that there is no impediment to the development of economic activities in buffer zones. With regard to climate, the defendant company argues that the oil and natural gas sector is crucial to Brazil's energy matrix and economy, and plays a central role in the transition to a low-carbon economy. It states that it is a fundamental industry for tackling global climate challenges, including to achieve the commitments of the Paris Agreement. It stresses that the energy transition must be fair, gradual and synchronized with the development of alternative sources, highlighting the continued importance of fossil fuels until 2050. The company states that, contrary to what the plaintiff claims, the offer of oil and gas exploration blocks is aligned with the country's energy security needs and climate goals, following the Federal Government's plans and its energy policy. Thus, it considers that the action seeks to implement public climate policies through the courts, which would be inappropriate and harmful to national sovereignty and development. It preliminarily requested that the case be dismissed without a decision on the merits, considering the lack of procedural interest, the regularity of the 4th Cycle of Permanent Offer of Concessions, the inappropriateness of the chosen avenue for discussing public policy, and the invasion of the competence of environmental agencies. In the alternative, it requested that the initial claims be dismissed in their entirety.",

Between 2021 and September 2024, in the same place, the defendant allegedly caused fires in the vegetation with the aim of clearing and maintaining pastures for cattle breeding. The lawsuit argues explicitly about the relationship between deforestation and climate change and its extreme effects at local and regional levels. It points out that Brazil's main source of greenhouse gas emissions is through deforestation, highlighting the situation in the Amazon and Brazil's commitments to reduce deforestation in the biome. It points out that the illegal deforestation in the case in point led to the emission of 534,613.750272 tons of carbon dioxide, which imposes the duty to compensate for material intermediate and residual climate damage. It uses the Amazon Fund's calculation basis to assign the value of US$ 5.00 for each ton of CO2 emitted, resulting in the quantification of compensation at R$ 15,236,491.88.

Also, carbon credit projects, especially in the REDD+ modality, have structural flaws that compromise their effectiveness in reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, serving more as an instrument for the commodification of traditionally occupied territories than as a real climate mitigation mechanism. As a preliminary injunction, it is requested that urgent relief be granted for the immediate suspension of SEMA/AM's administrative acts. On the merits, it calls for the project to be declared null and void and for the state of Amazonas to be ordered to compensate the affected communities for material and moral damage.",

      "summary": "The case centers on the validity of an exemption notification issued on September 24, 2015, which exempted 62 to 63 species of trees and plants from the regulatory provisions of the Transit Rules, 2000. The notification was challenged on the grounds that it was beyond the authority granted by the Forest Act of 1927 and violated Articles 14, 21, and 48-A of the Constitution of India.\r\n\r\nThe State of Madhya Pradesh issued a notification that exempted several species of forest produce from regulatory control. This notification was later amended to include additional species. As a result, concerns arose about large-scale deforestation and the illegal trading of timber, which were intensified by these exemptions. The court reviewed internal correspondence and inquiry reports that highlighted the negative impact of these exemptions on climate change and biodiversity of Madhya Pradesh.\r\n\r\nThe main issue was the validity and constitutionality of the exemption notification and its subsequent amendments. The court also examined the environmental impact of these exemptions, especially regarding climate change. It evaluated whether the exemptions were justified by compelling reasons, backed by data, research, and surveys. Furthermore, the court considered the necessity of periodic reviews and assessments of the exemptions to ensure they do not contribute to environmental degradation.\r\n\r\nIn doing so, the court quashed the exemption notification dated 24.09.2015 and its subsequent amendments, declaring them ultra vires the provisions of Secs. ​ 41(1), (2) & (3) of the Forest Act, 1927, and violative of Articles 14, 21, and 48-A of the Constitution of India. ​ The court found that the notification was issued without any independent background research, surveys, or empirical studies to demonstrate the compelling circumstances for exempting such a large number of species. ​ The annulment of the impugned notification revived the applicability of Transit Pass Rules, 2000 to all the previously exempted species. ​ The court emphasized that the regulatory measures under Sec. ​ 41(2) of the Forest Act are a norm, and the power to exempt under Sec. ​ 41(3) is an exception that must be exercised sparingly and with compelling reasons. ​\r\n\r\nThe judgment addresses the existential threat posed by climate change and underscores the critical role that forests play in mitigating its harmful effects. It points out the connection between fundamental rights and environmental issues, asserting that the right to a healthy environment is inherent in the right to life as stated in Article 21. The court mandates that judicial reviews of legislative actions or subordinate legislation must prioritize environmental protection and sustainable development, in line with both national and international commitments to combat climate change. The ruling highlights the importance of implementing regulatory measures to safeguard forests and natural resources, ensuring that any exemptions do not contribute to further environmental degradation.

The applicant, a citizen of Fiji, applied for a protection visa on 15 April 2018, asserting fears based on political opinion due to an altercation with Fijian government officials in 2015 concerning bauxite mining operations affecting communal farmland, environmental degradation, and associated climate change impacts.\r\n\r\nDuring the Tribunal hearing on 19 September 2022, the applicant expressed concerns about the potential economic hardship and threats to subsistence due to the environmental impacts from mining and climate-related effects on agriculture and fisheries near his village. He also raised broader concerns about political corruption, police brutality, and general insecurity in Fiji, particularly if he returned as a failed asylum seeker.\r\n\r\nHowever, on 21 September 2022, the Tribunal, presided over by Member Genevieve Hamilton, affirmed the original decision not to grant a protection visa. The Tribunal found that the applicant did not have a well-founded fear of persecution on political grounds, noting that after the 2015 incident with government officials, he had not experienced further persecution or targeting. The Tribunal concluded the environmental and climate-change-related hardships, although genuinely challenging, did not amount to persecution or pose a real risk of significant harm as defined under the Migration Act.\r\n\r\nConsequently, the Tribunal found no basis for Australia's protection obligations under either refugee or complementary protection criteria and affirmed the original refusal decision.\r\n",

During the hearing, the applicant indicated his primary motivation for seeking the visa was to work in Australia and financially support his family in Tonga. He denied ever expressing his political opinions in Tonga. The Tribunal considered country information about Tonga, which indicated that people can generally express their political views within the law and that safeguards against arbitrary arrest exist.

The AATA affirmed the decision not to grant a protection visa to an applicant from Vanuatu. The applicant's primary argument for seeking protection was the ongoing threat posed by natural disasters in Vanuatu, which they claimed have increased in frequency and severity due to climate change, leading to widespread destruction, displacement, and a lack of effective government response because of inadequate infrastructure. The applicant expressed fear for their safety and the safety of their loved ones due to these ongoing natural disasters and the inadequacy of infrastructure to cope with them. However, the Tribunal found that while *anuatu is indeed vulnerable to climate change and prone to natural disasters, as supported by reports from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT), the applicant's claimed fear of harm did not relate to any of the reasons for persecution outlined in the refugee definition under s 5J(1)(a) of the Migration Act 1958 (Cth). The Tribunal also considered the complementary protection criterion but was not satisfied that the applicant faced a real risk of significant harm (arbitrary deprivation of life, torture, or cruel and inhuman treatment) as a necessary and foreseeable consequence of being removed to Vanuatu due to the impacts of natural disasters or climate change.

The Department, however, argued that the documents contained deliberative material and that their disclosure would be contrary to the public interest as it could inhibit the generation of creative ideas, limit future policy options, and divert agency resources. The Tribunal considered whether the documents were exempt under the Freedom of Information Act 1982 (Cth), particularly sections relating to deliberative material (s 47C) and Cabinet documents (s 34). Ultimately, the Tribunal affirmed the decision to refuse access to most of the requested material, finding that the public interest in non-disclosure of the deliberative material concerning climate change scenarios outweighed the public interest in disclosure in most cases, as release had the potential to inhibit debates and discussions necessary for formulating suitable climate change policies for Australia.

The specific variation proposed by CIPL was to delete a requirement in the \"Carbon Credits (Carbon Farming Initiative) (Destruction of Methane from Piggeries using Engineered Biodigesters) Methodology Determination 2013\" that engineered biodigesters used in a project must have been replaced or installed after 1 July 2010.\r\n\r\nCIPL argued that this requirement punished early adopters of innovative technologies like themselves, who had commissioned a methane capture system in 1990, and created a commercial disadvantage. They also noted that similar date restrictions were not present in other methodology determinations related to agricultural emissions, such as those for piggeries using covered anaerobic lagoons or dairy manure.\r\n\r\nThe DOIC argued that removing the date restriction would be inconsistent with the CCCFI Act's objectives, particularly the \"abatement premise\" and additionality. They submitted that the baseline calculation in the methodology assumed no prior greenhouse gas capture, and allowing CIPL's existing biodigester to qualify would mean granting credits for abatement already occurring before 2010, thus not representing a new reduction in emissions incentivized by the CFI scheme. The DOIC contended that this would not meet the offset integrity standards and would undermine the purpose of the CCCFI Act to increase carbon abatement relative to the status quo.\r\n\r\nHowever, the Tribunal disagreed with the DOIC's position, finding that the scheme of the CCCFI Act is at odds with it. The Tribunal reasoned that the Act aims to create incentives for offsets projects that are not common practice. Projects involving the capture and combustion of methane from livestock manure are specified in the regulations for the purposes of the additionality test, indicating they are not considered common practice. The Tribunal stated that excluding \"pathfinders\" like CIPL, who had already adopted such practices, through a date restriction in the methodology determination would run counter to the additionality test they clearly pass. The Tribunal concluded that profitability in the absence of the scheme is irrelevant to the Act's objectives of incentivizing non-common practice abatement activities. Consequently, the Tribunal*set aside the DOIC's decision and substituted a decision endorsing CIPL's proposal to delete the 1 July 2010 requirement.",

SRGF, a former employee of the Australian Public Service (APS), claimed that his employment contributed significantly to his development of psychological conditions, including anxiety, depression, and chronic fatigue. The first claim focused on his time at the Clean Energy Regulator from 2013 to 2015, where he argued that the stress and ethical shortcomings of the APS, particularly surrounding the implementation and subsequent removal of the 'carbon tax', led to his initial psychological decline. He expressed feelings of disillusionment as staff continued to implement a policy they understood to be pointless following the change in government. The second claim related to his employment at the Department of Finance from 2017 to 2021, citing continual out-of-hours contact from SES personnel and interruptions to leave as significant contributing factors to a worsening of his mental state. Despite SRGF's contentions and the evidence he presented, including biometric data and personal accounts, Senior Member O'Donovan found that SRGF had not satisfied the Tribunal that his employment contributed to his psychological decline to a significant degree.

      "summary": "The Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AATA) affirmed a decision by the Clean Energy Regulator regarding a large-scale generation shortfall charge levied against TEC Pipe Pty Ltd. The central issue in the case was whether six electricity generators owned and operated by TEC Pipe at the Solomon Power Station constituted a \"standby plant\" as defined in the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Regulations 2000. The Solomon Power Station, located in the Pilbara, Western Australia, supplies electricity exclusively to the \"Solomon Hub\" mining area operated by FMG Solomon Pty Ltd.\r\n\r\nThe determination of whether these generators were \"standby plant\" was crucial because, according to Regulation 22, the capacity of a grid is the sum of all installed electricity generation capacity other than standby plant and privately owned domestic generators. If the generators were classified as standby plant, their capacity would not be included in the calculation of the Solomon Power Grid's capacity. TEC Pipe argued that each of its six generators produced less than 50GWh in each of the \"immediately preceding 3 years\" (prior to the 2014 assessment year) and therefore met the definition of standby plant in Regulation 3(1). TEC Pipe contended that because the grid's capacity would then be less than 100MW and not connected to a larger grid, its electricity acquisition in 2014 would not be a \"relevant acquisition\"under section 31(2)(a) of the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Act 2000 (the Act), and thus TEC Pipe would not be a \"liable entity\" subject to the large-scale generation shortfall charge under section 36(1).\r\n\r\nHowever, the Clean Energy Regulator argued that for a generator to be considered \"standby plant,\" it must have been installed and capable of producing electricity for each of those three preceding years. Since the six generators at the Solomon Power Station were commissioned in 2012, 2013, and 2014, the Regulator maintained they did not satisfy this condition. The Tribunal ultimately agreed with the Regulator's interpretation, holding that the phrase \"immediately preceding 3 years\" refers to the three calendar years before the assessment year and that the definition of \"standby plant\" implies the generators must have existed and been capable of producing for each of those years. Because the generators did not meet this criterion, they were not classified as \"standby plant,\" and their capacity was included in the grid's total, which exceeded 100MW. Consequently, TEC Pipe's electricity acquisition was deemed a \"relevant acquisition,\" making them a liable entity subject to the shortfall charge.",

The central issue was whether a $420,000 outgoing claimed as a deduction by Academy under section 8-1 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (ITAA 1997) was allowable. This outgoing related to an agreement entered into on 29 June 2009 with BR Redd Ltd for the purchase of three contract lots of \"sequestered carbon\". Academy paid a non-refundable deposit of $63,000 and intended to pay the $357,000 balance at a future, uncertain time when the property became deliverable. The taxpayer argued that the $420,000 was either incurred in gaining or producing its assessable income or necessarily incurred in carrying on its business for that purpose. The Commissioner contended that the outgoing was not incurred, was capital in nature, and was part of a scheme with the dominant purpose of obtaining a tax benefit, to which Part IVA of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (ITAA 1936) applied. The court heard evidence about the context of the proposed Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, Academy's business of providing cleaning and security services, its director Mr. Hughes' understanding of environmental sustainability's importance in winning tenders, and expert evidence regarding the carbon credit market. Ultimately, Justice Rares dismissed Academy's appeal, finding that the $357,000 balance was not definitively incurred in the 2009 year, that the $420,000 outgoing was not necessarily incurred in carrying on Academy's business, and that the dominant purpose of entering into the agreement was to obtain a tax benefit, thus Part IVA of the ITAA 1936 applied to disallow the deduction.\r\n",

      "summary": "On May 7, 2024, the Federal Executive filed an acción de inconstitucionalidad asking the Supreme Court to strike down an amendment made to articles 74 and 75 of the state of Querétaro’s Law that Regulates Drinking Water, Sewage, and Sanitation. The amendment specified that in cases where a person failed to pay for water services for two consecutive periods, the service provider was entitled to restrict water access to “at least 50 liters of water per person”. As context, it is important to note that the state of Querétaro allows private entities to provide water services whenever the state deems it necessary, and private entities prove they can provide equal or better services than local authorities. \r\n\r\nThe Federal Executive argued that the limit of 50 liters per person was contrary to the human right to water enshrined in Mexico’s Constitution. It argued that every human being has different needs depending on several factors and that Queretaro’s privatized water service system creates an incentive for providers to supply only the minimum required.\r\n\r\nOn April 21, 2025, the Supreme Court decided that the articles were constitutional. However, it specified that the limit imposed by the law should not be interpreted uniformly. Instead, since the law specifically said “at least 50 liters” it should be understood that whenever a person needs more water for their daily needs, service providers are bound to give them more than 50 liters. The Court explained that understanding the amendment as a uniform limit would create a disparate impact on certain vulnerable groups that faced socioeconomic hardships. Such could be the case of children, pregnant women, the elderly, people with certain illnesses, or people fasting for religious purposes. Additionally, the Court considered data on the rising temperatures because of climate change in the State of Querétaro and explicitly recognized that a uniform limit of 50 liters per person could trigger a case of environmental and climate injustice. As such, a limit of 50 liters per person should also be adjusted whenever an area of the state faces high temperatures. ",

      "summary": "The defendant participated in an Extinction Rebellion protest on December 4, 2021. The intention of the protest was to disrupt the journey of a freight train which, in part, comprised a shipment of coal destined for a Fonterra plant. The protest succeeded in causing the train to stop, and due to the protesters’ actions, the train was prevented from resuming its journey that day. The defendants were arrested when they refused to leave their positions on the track and in, or on, rolling stock. \r\n\r\nThe defendants faced various charges, including entering railway infrastructure without the express authority of the appropriate licensed access provider, and to knowingly obstructing employees of the New Zealand Railways Corporation in the performance of their duty which was amended to trespass. \r\n\r\nThe defence argued that the defence of necessity applied - that the defendants were acting to save lives that would be lost if climate change continued unabated, with particular reliance placed on the article “The mortality cost of carbon” by R Daniel Bressler. The central thesis of that article is that every 4,434 metric tonnes of carbon dioxide added to the atmosphere from 2020 will lead to one excess death globally between 2020 and 2100 ([72]). The Court accepted that it is indisputable that climate change threatens human wellbeing and planetary health, and did not doubt there the defendants believe that there is an impending catastrophic disaster in which lives will be lost as a consequence of climate change and unabated carbon dioxide emissions from the use of coal ([84]).\r\n\r\nHowever, the Court ultimately rejected the argument that the defence of necessity applied, in large part because the actions were to draw attention to climate change, and cannot be construed as “necessary to save lives” ([97]). Further, the Court found that necessity is not available in “direct action” cases, where “defendants essentially take the law into their own hands to interfere with lawful activities despite the availability of appropriate fora for addressing their concerns” ([101]). The Court also considered whether the threat must be imminent or immediate for the defence to apply, finding that all indicators pointed to the defence requiring an immediate risk of actual physical harm to a readily identifiable person or class of persons, which was not satisfied in the present case. The Court noted that while there is academic support for recasting the defence or broadening the concept of imminence to reflect the impending catastrophe of climate change, it was not open to the Court to interpret this element as sought, and instead “academic acknowledgement that the approach to imminence needs to be changed confirms that necessity is not available as the law currently stands” ([106]).",

She believes the New Zealand Government has failed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions adequately, and that other means of political activity to address the issue have failed to prompt the necessary action. The group seeks better passenger rail services within Aotearoa New Zealand and has taken to protesting on significant roadways. \r\n\r\nOn April 17, 2023, during morning rush hour, Ms Olsen allegedly took part in a protest blocking access to State Highway One in Wellington by endeavouring to glue her hand to the motorway with super glue. This alleged conduct resulted in Ms Olsen being charged with being a pedestrian on a motorway and, separately, endangering transport. Ms Olsen was released on ordinary bail, subject to conditions including not returning to Wellington, and not to encourage any illegal protest activity related to RPR. \r\n\r\nMs Olsen breached the terms of her bail by going to Wellington and allegedly participating in another protest blocking a main road in Wellington by gluing her hand to the road on April 20, 2023. The alleged conduct gave rise to a further charge of endangering transport. Ms Olsen was again released on ordinary bail. Subsequently, Ms Olsen breached the terms of her bail and went to Wellington, and it is alleged that on September 4, 2023, she attempted to cement her hand on the road to block traffic. Ms Olsen was charged, but this time the District Court “reluctantly” declined her bail, in large part due to a significant risk of reoffending while on bail, including because the Judge found that Ms Olsen had “demonstrated that she believes her cause justifies breaching the law”. \r\n\r\nMs Olsen appealed the District Court judgment. It was submitted that the Judge erred in failing to consider the importance of the climate emergency (in which RPR are trying to address), and failing to consider the historical importance of protest and of the right to protest. The District Court Judge did not refer to climate change or the right to protest in rights terms explicitly. \r\n\r\nThe High Court accepted the risks and dangers of climate change and the international obligations New Zealand owes to try and address it. The Court further accepted that a citizen’s right to protest is fundamental, and, as with all rights under the New Zealand Bill of Rights Act 1990, must be interpreted purposively (referencing Penwarden v R, a bail appeal relating to one of Ms Olsen’s alleged fellow protesters). However, while accepting on the face of it that the District Court Judge did not refer to climate change or to the right to protest in rights terms, Radich J found it was sufficiently clear that he took into account the fact that Ms Olsen was exercising a right to protest at the time of which she breached the conditions of her bail and of her subsequent arrest ([37]). \r\n\r\nDue to changed circumstances since the District Court hearing, the appeal was allowed (the circumstances being potential loss of job ([43]), and that a number of safety precautions had been taken before the alleged offending ([45]).

      "count": 1,
      "summary": "Greenpeace of New Zealand Incorporated (Greenpeace NZ) is part of the international Greenpeace movement that seeks a greener and more peaceful future. Greenpeace NZ’s focus in New Zealand now is advocacy for the protection of the environment, particularly protecting the environment and its population from climate change and protecting the ocean environment. \r\n\r\nGreenpeace NZ appealed from a decision of the Charities Registration Board |Te Rātā Atawhai (the Board) declining its application for registration as a charitable entity. This decision was made in the background of a legal case between the Charities Commission (now the Board), and Greenpeace NZ resulting in a Supreme Court decision (Re Greenpeace of New Zealand [2014] NZSC 105), where the Supreme Court remitted the decision back to the Board in light of its decision that a political purpose does not necessarily disqualify an organisation from charitable status if the advocacy is of public benefit. The Board declined Greenpeace NZ’s application, including because it advocated its own views on environmental issues and it could not be established that it was of public benefit and charitable ([6]). In addition to the appeal of the Board’s decision, Greenpeace NZ also applied for judicial review on the ground of apparent bias. Ultimately, Mallon J held that Greenpeace NZ was entitled to be registered as a charity and should be registered ([12]). \r\n\r\nThe Charities Act 2006 (CA) provides for the registration of entities as charitable entities, with a society qualifying for registration if it “is established and maintained exclusively for charitable purposes” and is “not carried on for the private pecuniary gain of any individual” (s 13(1)(b)). S 5 of the CA defines “charitable purpose”, which includes whether it relates to the relief of poverty, the advancement of education or religion, or any other matter beneficial to the community. Any purpose of the entity, that is not ancillary to its main purpose(s), must fit within one of the four heads of charity (relief of poverty, the advancement of education, the advancement of religion, or any other matter beneficial to the community) and be of public benefit ([15]). \r\n\r\nOne of the reasons the Board declined Greenpeace NZ’s application was because Greenpeace’s main activity is advocacy on causes that it considers will protect the environment (of which climate change falls within). In relation to climate change specifically, the Board found that “most of Greenpeace’s activities involve advocating its points of view on climate change and promoting those views to the public. The Board considers it is not possible to say whether the views promoted by Greenpeace on climate change are of a benefit in the way that the law recognises as charitable” ([76]). \r\n\r\nOn appeal, the Attorney-General submitted that, in relation to climate change, while it accepted that addressing climate change is a public benefit, and advocacy aimed at that goal may be a public benefit, it depends on what is being advocated. The Attorney-General compared where advocacy was “simply that there is an urgent need to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels” which might be of public benefit, versus if the advocacy was “that we must stop all deep-sea oil drilling now” which the Attorney-General submitted was not a public benefit because there are complex choices to be made ([81]). \r\n\r\nMallon J, in relation to climate change, found that “avoiding catastrophic climate change is also of benefit to the public. Advocacy to this end is a charitable purpose of public benefit, depending on its nature. Greenpeace NZ’s advocacy promotes reducing global emissions by limiting fossil fuel use and switching to clean energy. It is uncontroversial science that is an available mitigation measure” ([90]). Ultimately, the Court held that the Board erred in finding that campaigning for the protection of the environment (including climate change) was not a charitable purpose of public benefit ([101]). ",

The relevant proposed rules, Rules 26 to 30, sought to regulate the effects of oil exploration and drilling activities (Proposed Rules). \r\n\r\nThe Court held that s 70A of the RMA prevents the Court from considering (a) the effects of discharges into air of greenhouse gases on climate change (which in the context of the appeal, included the proposed rules); and (b) the effects of any activities incidental to those listed in Rules 26 to 30, insofar as they may have effects on climate change ([37]). \r\n\r\nClimate Justice Taranaki (CJT) argued that the Taranaki Regional Council (Council) had a responsibility to anticipate the effects of climate change and prepare a resilient plan for the Region. CJT was concerned about the costs of sunset industry and increasing liabilities ([39]). The Environment Court noted Council’s argument that the effects CJT seeks to address are not the effects of climate change, but effects that may result from regulatory responses to climate change which are too remote to be regulated. \r\n\r\nA further preliminary consideration was to what extent, if any, ocean acidification could be considered, with CJT arguing it is not excluded from consideration by s 70A. However, the Council argued that ocean acidification and climate change are so linked that to seek to reduce ocean acidification by making a rule to reduce CO2 emissions is, in essence, requesting consideration of the effects on climate change ([36]). The Court found that it could not determine as a preliminary matter whether ocean acidification fell within the definition of climate change in the RMA - however it did note that “insofar as ocean acidification is entwined with climate change, it is unhelpful to rely on it as a means of seeking to amend the [Proposed Rules] to address the effects of those activities on climate change. Parliament’s policy is clear. It is for Parliament to regulate the effects of activities on climate change, not this Court” ([43]). ",

The suit alleges that former board and supervisory board members breached their fiduciary duties by approving the high-risk coal investment in 2018, despite financial and climate-related warnings.\r\n\r\nEnea’s decision to pursue the claim followed a 2021 audit by Poland’s Supreme Audit Office, which found failures in the company’s risk management and recommended accountability for the project’s losses. Shareholders formally approved the lawsuit in January 2024 with 87% support at an extraordinary general meeting.\r\n\r\nThe project had faced early opposition from minority shareholder ClientEarth, which initiated legal action in 2018 alleging the investment breached directors’ duties of due diligence. A 2019 court decision ruled the AGM resolution approving the plant invalid. The plant was eventually abandoned mid-construction in 2020, and Enea wrote off nearly PLN 1 billion.\r\n\r\nThe current lawsuit seeks to establish civil liability of both the individuals responsible for the decision and the insurers who provided cover under D&O policies.

The lawsuit sought to nullify the bidding process under DNIT Notice 130/2021, which initiated the tender for construction work on the BR-364 highway segment connecting the municipality of Cruzeiro do Sul, Acre, to the Brazil-Peru border, crossing the Serra do Divisor National Park (PNSD).\r\n\r\nFrom a climate perspective, the plaintiffs argued that deforestation caused by the project would degrade the Amazon rainforest—the Earth’s primary carbon sink—which prevents greenhouse gases from accumulating in the atmosphere and excessively warming the planet. The forest is essential for mitigating climate change and reducing its effects. They also emphasized that indigenous peoples, particularly isolated groups, are especially vulnerable to the impacts of such projects.

      "summary": "On June 10, 2024 the Mato Grosso State Public Prosecutor's Office (MPMT) filed a Public Civil Action (ACP), with a request for an injunction, against Carlos Aparecido da Silva for deforestation of an area of 11.31 hectares on the Dois Irmãos farm, located in the state of Mato Grosso, as found in Civil Inquiry 025/2023. The MPMT alleges that the defendant is the owner of the property and that native vegetation was cleared without authorization from the environmental agency. It argues that the reparation of environmental damage requires, in addition to the recovery of the biome itself, the repair of the incidental factors of the degradation caused, such as the increase in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, and highlights the principle of climate integrity preservation enshrined in the Brazilian legal system. As an injunction for urgent relief, it requests, among other things, that the defendant be prohibited from economically exploiting the areas that could be used for deforestation without authorization from the environmental agency. In the final instance, the restoration of the degraded area and the payment of compensation for material and moral damages in the amount of R$ 93,498.53 (ninety-three thousand, four hundred and ninety-eight Brazilian Reais and fifty-three centavos) are requested.\r\n\r\nThe action was initially filed with the Mato Grosso State Court under case number 1004977-80.2024.8.11.0006, and on June 10, the court granted the request for urgent relief. \r\n\r\nOn July 11, 2024, the defendant filed its defense claiming that the area is part of the Agrarian Reform Settlement Project called Assentamento Limoeiro and that it has a land tenure relationship, with the Federal Government being the legitimate owner who must respond to the lawsuit together with National Institute for Colonization and Agrarian Reform (INCRA). He claims that the Federal Court has jurisdiction to hear the case and that he has authorization to exploit the area in question, and that the notice of infraction is generic. He therefore requested that his lack of standing to be sued be recognized, that the emergency relief granted be suspended, that the court declare that it lacks jurisdiction, and that the action be dismissed with the notice of infraction declared null and void.\r\n\r\nThe lack of jurisdiction was recognized, and the case was referred to the Federal Court, now under number 1003895-08.2024.4.01.3601.",

The NGOs contend that these plans lack adequate and effective measures to transform the stated commitments into tangible outcomes and fail to incorporate meaningful public participation in developing socially equitable policies. Despite the deadline for submission of NECPs having passed on June 30, 2024, only 14 Member States have complied, and the coalition asserts that these delays and deficiencies undermine the EU’s overarching climate objectives and the principle of a just transition for its citizens.\r\n\r\nThe complaint against Germany, submitted by the organization Germanwatch, alleges that Germany’s NECP breaches European Union law. Specifically, Germanwatch alleges that Germany’s NECP is legally insufficient, lacking concrete measures and the ambition necessary for meeting the EU’s 2030 climate and energy targets. \r\n\r\nGermany’s NECP reaffirms its notable ambition to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 55% by 2030 in comparison to 1990 levels, which is a target outlined in Germany's Federal Climate Action Law, adopted in 2019. Germany’s NECP also reflects the state’s long-term goal of achieving climate neutrality by 2050. To achieve these commitments, the NECP incorporates key measures from the “2030 Climate Protection Plan”, otherwise referred to as the “Climate Package”. A key component of this package includes the introduction of national carbon pricing under the Fuel Emissions Trading Act, which took effect in 2021. The pricing mechanism is intended to ensure that Germany meets its 2030 targets, specifically targeting the transport and heating sectors absent from the EU Emissions Trading System (ETS). \r\n\r\nGermanwatch contends that the NECP remains insufficiently ambitious, referencing a lack of clarity in the NECP’s outlining of how the state will meet its goals. The complaint asserts that the national CO2 pricing scheme, although a step forward, sets too low of prices to drive meaningful emissions reductions. In order to stay on track with its 2030 goals, Germanwatch contends that a rapid price increase between 2026 and 2030 would be necessary, posing risks for the effectiveness and social acceptance of the intiative. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, Germanwatch states that Germany’s non-ETS targets under the EU Effort Sharing target, specifically a 38% reduction of greenhouse gases by 2030 compared to 2005 levels, lack robustness and clarity in their policies. The target of reducing the share of primary energy consumption set at a 30% share of renewable energy in the gross final energy consumption by 2030 also represents minimal ambition, according to Germanwatch. Germanwatch also acknowledges the removal of references to the Tenant Electricity Supply Act in the state’s NECP, outlining the Act’s potential to enable equitable access to solar energy in urban areas, and how its removal results in insufficient measures to ensure social equity in the energy transition. \r\n\r\n*Pursuant to EU law, the European Commission is mandated to ensure that Member States fulfill their legal obligations. Should the Commission determine that a Member State is in breach, it may initiate formal infringement proceedings to bring national legislation and practices into compliance with EU law.

EJNI specifically highlights the NECP’s failure to set clear pathways for phasing out fossil fuel subsidies. EJNI contends that the NECP fails to provide adequate timelines or strategies for eliminating these subsidies as outlined in the EU’s Governance Regulation. EJNI also references the NECP’s failure to outline sufficient policies and measures necessary for achieving Ireland’s 2030 Effort Sharing targets, as well as its Land Use, Land Use Change, and Forestry targets, both failing to comply with the EU’s Governance Regulation. \r\n\r\nWithin its complaint, EJNI contends that the NECP’s lack of a nationwide strategy for ensuring a just transition is non-compliant with the EU's Governance Regulation, as it fails to include a comprehensive nationwide approach to addressing the socio-economic impacts of the climate and energy transition. Furthermore, EJNI argues that the updated NECP lacks a sufficient assessment of energy poverty in Ireland, failing to consider the “essential domestic energy services needed to maintain basic living standards in the national context” and the European Commission’s guidance on energy poverty indicators. EJNI asserts that the insufficient information on energy poverty is an area of non-compliance with the EU’s Governance Regulation. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, EJNI contends that the state’s NECP included inadequate public participation, as outlined in the EU’s Governance Regulation and Aarhus Convention.

      "summary": "Oceana UK, represented by public interest law firm Leigh Day, filed a complaint on August 22, 2024 against the United Kingdom's decision on the issuing of 28 licenses for oil and gas exploration. Between October 2023 and May 2024, the UK, through the North Sea Transition Authority, issued 82 oil and gas exploration licenses, with Oceana UK contending the unlawfulness of 28 of those licenses. The licenses cover 226 blocks in the North Sea, with over ⅔ of the licenses residing in marine protected areas. The 82 licenses issued are expected to result in 600 million barrels of oil equivalent, while oil spills were not considered in the impact assessments of the issued licenses. \r\n\r\nOceana UK contends that these licenses were unlawful on several grounds, including failure to consider environmental risks, the dismissal of expert advice, and climate impact oversight. 21 out of the 28 licenses are inside designated marine protected areas, which typically protect wildlife like harbour porpoise, grey seals, and puffins. Oceana UK asserts that the potential for accidental oil spills in these areas was unlawfully excluded in the environmental impact assessments of the licenses, with the occurrence of “more than two oil or chemical spills every day last year from oil and gas developments in UK waters”. The spills over the last year resulted in over 82,000 kg of oil spilling into the sea, posing risks for nearby habitats. Oceana UK also outlines the need for environmental impact assessments to account for emissions, referencing the precedent law established by the Finch ruling. \r\n\r\nOceana UK also contends that the dismissal of expert advice from independent government advisors was unlawful, referencing the UK government’s overlooking of advice from the Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC) and Natural England when granting the licenses. Oceana UK asserts that this expert advice was not adequately considered in the environmental assessments conducted by the government. \r\n\r\nThe case was heard in the High Court on 26-27 March 2025.

      "summary": "On January 23, 2025, the Brazilian Institute for Consumer Protection (IDEC) filed a judicial inquiry against Gol Linhas Aéreas S.A. This action is part of a set of two inquiries filed by IDEC alleging greenwashing and problems in the use of carbon credits from the voluntary market. In this case against Gol, the airline's voluntary carbon offset actions through its ‘Meu Voo Compensa’ (My Flight Offsets) programme are being questioned. IDEC questions the transparency, effectiveness, and veracity of the company's claims regarding the neutralisation of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, as well as the integrity of the carbon credits purchased and disclosed as sustainable. According to the initial petition, Gol's greenwashing practice consists of using marketing and communication strategies to induce consumers to believe that its operations are environmentally responsible, without concrete, verifiable, and effective measures to justify such claims. An example of this conduct is the use of an aircraft identified as ‘Green Plane’ to reinforce its sustainable image, even though the aircraft did not have any technical or operational features that made it effectively more environmentally friendly. IDEC requires GOL Linhas Aéreas to respond to a set of questions related to transparency, the legal nature, and calculation and compensation methods of the My Flight Offsets programme, as well as the allocation of amounts paid by consumers and other environmental actions disclosed by the company.\r\n\r\nOn March 14, 2025, Gol Linhas Aéreas responded to the inquiry, denying the practice of greenwashing and maintaining that its sustainability actions are transparent, audited, and based on internationally recognised methodologies. The company highlights that it uses the GHG Protocol to calculate emissions and purchases carbon credits validated by the international certifier Verra, with tracking via blockchain. The company also reports that it has published sustainability reports audited by Ernst & Young, reaffirming its commitment to ESG practices and GHG reduction. Gol argues that carbon offsetting is a voluntary measure paid for by passengers, not a donation, and that its actions are unrelated to the Operation Greenwashing investigations, although, as a precaution, it has suspended its partnership with Moss, the climatech company previously responsible for the programme, and is in the process of hiring a new partner. Finally, it reiterates that its institutional communication seeks to inform, not mislead, consumers, defending the legitimacy of its environmental initiatives and requesting recognition of the regularity of its conduct and the absence of any violation of environmental and consumer rights.",

      "summary": "On January 23, 2025, the Brazilian Institute for Consumer Protection (IDEC) filed a judicial inquiry against the car rental company Localiza Rent A CAR S/A. This action is part of a set of two inquiries proposed by IDEC alleging greenwashing and problems in the use of carbon credits from the voluntary market. In this case, Localiza is questioned about offering rental services with greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions offsets through its ‘Carbon Neutrality’ and ‘Commitment to the Climate’ programmes. However, IDEC believes that this initiative may constitute greenwashing due to the imprecise origin of the carbon credits, the apparent lack of information on the real benefits, and the effectiveness of the methods used to achieve the stated objectives. IDEC believes that there are indications of greenwashing due to gaps in the information collected through the respondent's website. Furthermore, the offer is not in accordance with consumer law, as it violates objective good faith, as well as the basic consumer right to freedom of choice and adequate and clear information, all of which are provided for in the Consumer Protection Code. The payment of an additional amount in the car rental contract to offset GHG emissions requires justification in order to be considered an offer that complies with consumer rights. However, consumers are misled due to a lack of adequate information and thus believe that the respondent will provide a service that has less impact on the environment. Greenwashing is characterised as unfair practices that downplay risks and threats to socio-environmental rights. Therefore, it is believed that the respondent uses this resource because GHG emission compensation programmes have a positive impact on its image. Firstly, because the service provided would be guided by ESG standards, generating a favourable image for the company. In addition, it reaches a fraction of consumers who base their consumption on social and environmental criteria. The purpose of the Judicial Inquiry is to enable Localiza to provide detailed explanations of its GHG emission compensation practices and to allow the respondent to correct any inconsistencies. The plaintiff requests that documents be provided to prove the veracity of the benefits of the programes offered in the car rental service, as well as that the questions presented about the programmes be answered.",

However, in 2020 the Mexican Congress reformed the Law and eliminated the Climate Change Fund.\r\n\r\nOn November 30, 2020, Greenpeace Mexico filed a lawsuit against these amendments, arguing that they violated the constitutional right to a healthy environment. \r\n\r\nOn March 30, 2023, the District Court dismissed the case, deciding that the plaintiff did not have standing because the amendments did not impact them, considering that Greenpeace did not prove that it was beneficiary of the Climate Change Fund or that it had an application in process to access the Climate Change Fund’s resources. \r\n\r\nOn April 17, 2023, the plaintiff appealed the decision.

It decided that the amendments violate the right to a healthy environment because they eliminated the general rules that existed to regulate the financing, evaluation and oversight of projects and programs to address climate change, which affected principles such as efficiency, transparency and honesty in the use of the public budget. In addition, it decided that the legislator did not adequately justify the disappearance of the Fund. Accordingly, the Supreme Court granted the relief so that the amendments could not be applied, neither now nor in the future, in proceedings in which the NGO seeks access to public funds intended to mitigate the effects of climate change, including trusts or other similar instruments.",

The plaintiff challenged the issuing of the development consent order under section 114 of the Planning Act 2008 “for a new gas-fired electricity generating station at Teesside with Carbon Capture Utilization and Storage”. The plaintiff contends that the Secretary of State for Energy Security and Net Zero committed a legal error when assessing the significance of the greenhouse gas emissions that would result from the power plant. \r\n\r\nThe Planning Act 2008 governs nationally significant infrastructure projects (NSIPs), requiring the Secretary of State to conduct an Environmental Impact Assessment and to consider National Policy Statements before issuing development consent. In this case, the relevant National Policy Statement is EN-1, which “addresses GHG emissions and the UK’s net-zero targets.”\r\n\r\nThe plaintiff provided four grounds for judicial review, as follows. \r\n\r\nGround 1 - The claimant alleged that the Secretary of State failed to provide legally adequate reasons for its conclusion that the development of the power plant would contribute to the transition to net zero. The claimant contended that the Secretary of State relied on the Institute of Environmental Management Assessment (IEMA) guidance to find that the project constituted greenhouse gas emissions with a significant adverse effect, deeming it incompatible with net-zero trajectories. On this point, the plaintiff alleged inconsistencies in the Secretary of State’s decision.  \r\n\r\nGround 2 - The plaintiff argued that the Secretary for Energy Security and Net Zero erred in its interpretation of paragraph 5.2.2 of National Policy Statement EN-1, which states that CO2 emissions from fossil fuel-based infrastructure are significant. The plaintiff alleged that the Secretary of State misapplied the paragraph by also using it to shape the policy weight given to those emissions in the planning balance. \r\n\r\nGround 3 - The plaintiff alleged that the Secretary of State was unlawfully endorsing the use of the IEMA guidance while also assessing significance in different ways without providing adequate reasoning.\r\n\r\nGround 4 - The plaintiff challenged the Secretary of State’s need for the project. \r\n\r\nOn August 20, 2024, the High Court rejected all four grounds for challenge, dismissing the application for judicial review. Dr. Andrew Boswell appealed the decision on the first three grounds introduced at the High Court, which the Court of Appeal later dismissed on May 22, 2025. The Court of Appeal held that there was no legal inconsistency in accepting the IEMA guidance and determining that the development contributed to net zero goals, that paragraph 5.2.2 was lawfully interpreted, and that the Secretary of State could lawfully rely on IEMA guidance as long as their reasoning was clear. \r\n\r\nDr. Andrew Boswell has now submitted a new claim for judicial review along with Good Law Project, contending that the government subsidy for the project unlawfully underwrites the developer's loans.

First, the establishment of conservancies in Chari ward and Cherab violated procedural elements such as public participation. Second, the Bulesa Biliqo community conservancy was operating illegally and was therefore halted. Third, a permanent injunction was granted regarding the mapping, surveying, entering, and recruitment for conservation efforts in the respective locales. \r\n",

The application was submitted within the perimeter of an existing, 25-year mining title granted in 2009. Bridge Energies request was supplemented on November 22, 2022, and granted via an official decree on January 30, 2024, by the Prefect. Eau de Paris, the public entity that manages Paris’s drinking water supply, filed a complaint on March 29, 2024, seeking the annulment of the prefectural order and the relief of 3000 EUR from the State and Bridge Energies. The plaintiff specifically seeks relief under Article L. 761-1 of the Code of Administrative Justice. \r\n\r\nIn its complaint, the plaintiff alleged that the authorization of the prefectural permit followed an impact study that “presents deficiencies regarding the project’s effects on water resources, or climate change, on reasonable alternatives, and on biodiversity.” The plaintiff contends that the project ignores Article L. 414-4 of the Environmental Code, as it fails to “assess impacts on Natura 2000 sites.” The plaintiff contends that the permit application fails to analyze compatibility with the “water-management master plan for the Seine basin and Norman coastal rivers”, causing a breach in Article 6 of Decree No. 2006-649 of June 2, 2006. The plaintiff argues that “the order suffers from a procedural defect”, considering the inquiry commissioner failed to issue “reasoned, impartial, and objective findings.” The plaintiff also alleges that the project violates Article L. 161-1 of the Mining Code because it poses significant risks for water resources and natural habitats and that the project “contravenes the local urban-planning code of the commune of Nonville.” \r\n\r\nThe case proceeded before the Tribunal Administratif de Melun, which issued its judgment on January 30, 2025. The court found that the prefectural authorization contained multiple legal defects, specifically in its inadequate evaluation of biodiversity and resource impacts and its insufficient pollution prevention measures. The court did not fully annul the permit, instead issuing a sursis à statuer (suspension of judgment). This suspension grants the State and Bridge Energies a ten-month period to mend the identified deficiencies. The court stated that it will issue a final decision at the end of this period. ",

      "type": "case",
      "count": 1,
      "summary": "The constitutional review case of Hungary’s Climate Protection Act (Act XLIV of 2020) was initiated by fifty members of Parliament, who argued that several provisions of the Act violated the Hungarian Fundamental Law (Alaptörvény) and certain international treaties, including the Paris Agreement and the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The petitioners submitted their application in 2021 (case no. II/3536/2021), challenging, among other things, the emission reduction targets laid out in Article 3(1) of the Act. They argued that the Act’s 2030 target—a 40% reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions compared to 1990 levels—was insufficient, fell short of both European Union commitments (which call for at least 55% reductions), and failed to align with the scientific consensus necessary to meet the Paris Agreement’s 1.5°C temperature goal. They also claimed that the Act lacked concrete implementation measures and disregarded principles such as precaution and intergenerational equity.\r\n\r\nThe Constitutional Court found that Article 3(1) of the Climate Protection Act was unconstitutional. Specifically, the Court held that the provision violated Article P(1), Article XX(1), and Article XXI(1) of the Fundamental Law, which enshrine the principles of intergenerational justice, the right to physical and mental health, and the right to a healthy environment. The Court emphasized that the emission target failed to uphold the constitutional duty to preserve natural resources for future generations and to take adequate preventive and precautionary action against foreseeable climate risks.\r\n\r\nThe Court did not accept the argument that this provision conflicted with international treaties, including the Paris Agreement. However, it emphasized the state's duty to take climate measures that align with Hungary's constitutional obligations and broader international climate goals.\r\n\r\nOn June 12, 2025, the Court ruled that Article 3(1) of the Climate Protection Act is unconstitutional and annulled it, effective June 30, 2026. This delayed annulment gives the legislature time to revise the law.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the Court determined—acting ex officio—that Parliament committed a constitutional omission by failing to adopt comprehensive, climate-specific measures tailored to Hungary’s and the Carpathian Basin’s needs. These include not only mitigation (beyond traditional emissions regulation) but also adaptation and resilience measures. The Court ordered Parliament to fulfill this legislative obligation by June 30, 2026.\r\n\r\nThe Court dismissed or rejected other parts of the petition, including challenges to Articles 1, 2, 3(2)-(3), and 4 of the Act, either for lack of legal merit or procedural insufficiency.\r\n\r\nIn sum, this decision is a landmark ruling in Hungarian climate law. It enforces constitutional obligations related to environmental protection and intergenerational equity and requires the legislature to adopt more ambitious and specific climate policies in line with constitutional principles.\r\n",

Advertising a product as climate neutral can always be significant in the purchasing decision of customers\r\n2.

An Bord Pleanála, the Government of Ireland, Ireland, and the Attorney General ([2025] IEHC 158), the Irish High Court considered a judicial review challenge to two planning permissions granted for a large-scale data center and substation development in Ennis, County Clare. The applicants filed the case on May 30, 2024, seeking to quash the permissions issued by An Bord Pleanála on April 5, 2024. These permissions concerned (1) the construction of six two-story data center buildings with a combined floor area of over 118,000 square meters, powered in part by 66 diesel generators and a 120MW gas-powered facility, and (2) the construction of a new 110kV substation and underground transmission cables. The Court granted leave to apply for judicial review on June 26, 2024, and set a hearing for February 25, 2025. In advance of that hearing, An Bord Pleanála conceded one of the applicants’ key claims, leading the Court to focus on a limited but legally significant issue.\r\n\r\nAmong the various legal grounds raised, the applicants argued that the Board failed to comply with its statutory obligations under Section 15 of the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development Act 2015, as amended by the 2021 Act. That provision requires public authorities, insofar as practicable, to exercise their functions consistently with the national climate objective, the most recent approved Climate Action Plan, and the goals of mitigating greenhouse gas emissions and adapting to climate change. The applicants contended that the Board’s approval of a fossil fuel–intensive project, with no binding requirement to transition to renewable energy sources, was irrational and inadequately reasoned. They further argued that the Board impermissibly relied on speculative claims about future availability of sustainable gas, while requiring no meaningful emissions mitigation measures. Although the Court ultimately did not rule on the climate issues at this stage of proceedings, the arguments remain part of the broader legal challenge.\r\n\r\nThe Court’s March 21, 2025 decision centered on a discrete but critical factual error in the Board’s Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA). Specifically, the planning inspector incorrectly stated that no bat roosts were identified within the development site, despite the existence of a confirmed Leisler’s bat roost in Building 6C. This omission was acknowledged by the Board, which conceded that the inspector’s error undermined the legality of its assessment. The Court rejected arguments from the developer that the error was immaterial, emphasizing that under European Union law, any destruction of a protected bat roost constitutes a significant environmental impact. Because the Board failed to properly consider that impact—let alone assess the need for a derogation license under the Habitats Directive—the Court quashed both planning permissions. ",

The challenge was filed under Article 67BA of the Roads (Northern Ireland) Order 1993. The major infrastructure project was aimed at improving the A5 route between Derry and Aughnacloy, which has been a lasting safety concern, resulting in numerous civilian deaths. \r\n\r\nThe plaintiff alleged that the DfI’s decision failed to comply with Section 52 of the Climate Change (Northern Ireland) Act 2022. This section mandates public authorities to have regard and act in accordance with the legally binding Climate Action Plan, which was not in place at the time the DfI decided to proceed with the project. On these grounds, the plaintiff contends that DfI did not have a proper legal framework to ensure it was complying with Ireland’s climate targets, specifically an emissions reduction cap. \r\n\r\nThe plaintiff also contended that the defendant failed to take into account a critical relevant consideration, or a recently updated Climate Action Plan, when it approved the plan. The plaintiff also alleged that the DfI acted unlawfully by disregarding the Planning Appeals Commission’s recommendation of imposing a time limit for the project’s development, representing a breach in procedural fairness. The plaintiff contended that the lack of a time limit caused uncertainty for the landowners and residents near the project, failing to comply with Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which protects the right to respect for private and family life. \r\n\r\nThe court issued a judgment stating that the DfI acted unlawfully by making a decision inconsistent with Section 52 of the Climate Change (Northern Ireland) Act 2022. The court also stated that the DfI ignored a critical relevant consideration as it proceeded without an updated Climate Action Plan and that DfI violated the principles of procedural fairness when prolonging uncertainty for landowners and residents. The court also ruled that the time limit violations constituted a human rights violation, and ultimately quashed the DfI’s decision to proceed with the project. \r\n",
