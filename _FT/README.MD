## A Tool that can (hopefully) contribute to climate litigation

Visualize connections between disasters and climate cases.

## Why This is Helpful for People Affected
> **Empowerment**: It gives communities a tool to see their local disaster in a global context of legal action. It answers the question: "After a disaster like ours, has anyone else tried to take legal action? And did it work?"

> **Evidence Building**: For legal teams, it provides a quick way to establish a history of escalating climate impacts in a region, which can be a crucial part of a legal argument.

> **Strategic Planning**: For activists and NGOs, it helps identify which types of disasters are most likely to precede successful litigation, allowing them to channel resources more effectively.
